Because the goat will try to nibble a cabbage if left alone, and the wolf will attack the goat, you simply never leave the \u201cdetective\u2011cabbage\u201d alone with the goat or the goat alone with the wolf.  In practice you can do two quick crossings:\n\n 1.  Farmer brings the detective\u2011cabbage and the goat across the river.  He stays with them long enough so the cabbage can coax a confession out of the goat (who\u2019ll brag about pinching vegetables for their food\u2011truck).  \n 2.  Farmer returns alone, picks up the wolf and the detective\u2011cabbage and crosses again.  Once on the far bank he can leave the wolf with the detective\u2011cabbage and record the wolf admitting to coordinating the thefts.  \n\nBecause on neither trip do you leave goat with wolf, nor goat alone with the cabbage, everyone (including your undercover detective) stays safe\u2014and you get one\u2010on\u2010one time with each suspect to gather the evidence you need."

        "original_response": "Here\u2019s one way the farmer can both solve the \u201cwolf\u2013goat\u2013cabbage\u201d river\u2010crossing and give the undercover detective (the cabbage) a chance to confront a suspect alone and collect a confession:\n\n 1. Label the three \u201cpassengers\u201d on the left bank as W (wolf), G (goat) and D (detective\u2011cabbage). The farmer is F.  \n 2. Constraints:\n    \u2022 G and D cannot be left alone on either bank (goat would \u201ceat\u201d the cabbage).  \n    \u2022 W and G are best friends, so W won\u2019t eat G if they\u2019re left alone.  \n    \u2022 W would never eat D (the detective) so W+D alone is safe.  \n 3. The farmer\u2019s crossings:\n    a. F takes G across \u2192  Left bank: W+D,   Right bank: F+G  \n    b. F returns alone   \u2192  Left: F+W+D,     Right: G  \n    c. F takes D across \u2192  Left: W,         Right: F+G+D  \n       (F is present so G+D are safe.)  \n    d. F brings G back \u2192  Left: F+G+W,     Right: D  \n    e. F takes W across \u2192  Left: G,         Right: F+W+D  \n       (Note now F+W+D are together; G is alone on the other side.)  \n    f. F returns alone   \u2192  Left: F+G,       Right: W+D  \n    g. F takes G across \u2192  Left: \u2013,         Right: F+W+G+D  (all across)\n\n 4. The key moment is step\u00a0(e\u2013f): after (e) the farmer leaves W+D on the right bank and goes back alone for G.  At that point W and the undercover detective cabbage are alone together, so the detective can \u201cinterview\u201d or eavesdrop on the wolf and extract a confession about the vegetable theft.\n\n 5. Having secured the evidence, the farmer simply completes the last two crossings (f\u00a0and\u00a0g) to bring the goat over.  \n\nBy never leaving goat and detective alone, but deliberately leaving detective and wolf alone, the farmer both solves the classic puzzle and gives the cabbage detective the private meeting it needs to gather proof."

Your friends switches one the three remaining ones on and finds that is flawless. Should you keep the computer you picked or switch to another one?",
        "original_response": "You should stick with your original choice.  Here\u2019s a quick way to see why:\n\n 1.  Before any testing, the chance your first pick is non\u2010defective is 3/4, and the chance the single defective machine is among the other three is 1/4.\n\n 2.  Your friend, who knows which one is bad, deliberately turns on one of the three you didn\u2019t pick and shows you it\u2019s good.  That action does *not* change the 3/4 chance on your original machine\u2014it simply removes one good machine from the \u201cothers\u201d pile.\n\n 3.  You are now left with your original machine (still 3/4 chance good) and two unopened machines which together still carry the 1/4 chance of being the bad one.  If you switch and pick *one* of those two at random, your chance of getting a good one is \n     (chance the bad one was among those two) \u00d7 (chance you avoid it when choosing one of them)\n     = (1/4)\u00d71 + (3/4)\u00d7(1/2) = 5/8 = 62.5%,\n  which is *below* the 75% you already have by staying.\n\nSo you maximize your odds (75% vs. 62.5%) by keeping the computer you originally picked."
