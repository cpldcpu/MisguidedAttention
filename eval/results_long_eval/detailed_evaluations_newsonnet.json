According to quantum mechanics, before the box is opened, the cat is theoretically in a superposition of states (both alive and dead simultaneously)\n\nSince your question specifies that a dead cat was placed in the box to begin with, the probability of the cat being alive when the box is opened is 0% (zero). A dead cat cannot become alive again, regardless of any quantum mechanics involved.\n\nIf you meant to ask about the original thought experiment with a live cat, the probability would depend on the half-life of the specific radioactive isotope used in the experiment."

The actual experiment uses:\n- A live cat\n- A radioactive source\n- A radiation detector\n- A vial of poison\n- A hammer mechanism\n\nWhen the box is opened after one day, the probability of finding the cat alive depends on the half-life of the radioactive isotope used.

The outcome is deterministic because the initial condition (a dead cat) makes the other elements of the experiment irrelevant to the cat's state.\n\nIn the original Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat thought experiment, a live cat is placed in the box, and the probability question becomes more complex, illustrating quantum superposition principles."

This makes it a paradox - there is no logically consistent answer to whether the barber shaves himself.\n\nRussell created this paradox to illustrate problems in set theory and logic, specifically the issues that arise when a set refers to itself. It's similar to the statement \"This sentence is false\" - it creates an irresolvable logical loop.\n\nThe paradox demonstrates that the initial premise (the existence of such a barber) must be impossible, as it leads to a logical contradiction."

Here's why:\n\nInitially, your chances of picking the car were 1/3, and the chances of the car being behind either of the other doors were 2/3. When the host opens a door with a goat (which they always do, knowing where the car is), the original 2/3 probability is now concentrated on the remaining unopened door you didn't choose.\n\nSo:\n- If you stick with your original choice: 1/3 chance of winning\n- If you switch to the other unopened door: 2/3 chance of winning\n\nTherefore, switching doubles your chances of winning the car. While this may seem counterintuitive, it's mathematically proven to be true."
