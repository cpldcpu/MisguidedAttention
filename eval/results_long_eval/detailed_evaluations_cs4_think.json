You can mark the 25-minute point by noting that it occurs 5 minutes before rope A burns out (though this requires estimation) or use the fact that 45 - 25 = 20.\n\nAlternatively, you can consider the 20 minutes as the period from when rope A burns out (30 min) plus an additional 5 minutes into rope B's final burn phase, but the most practical measurement is using the total 45-minute timeline to calculate the 20-minute interval you need."

However, it tells us nothing about whether the barber shaves himself.\n\nThe question of whether the barber shaves himself is simply not addressed by the given rule. He could shave himself, or he could not shave himself, or he could have someone else shave him. The rule only governs his behavior toward his customers/visitors, not his personal grooming habits.\n\nSo the answer is: **We cannot determine whether the barber shaves himself based on the information given.** The rule doesn't create any logical paradox or constraint regarding the barber's own shaving habits.\n\nNote: This appears to be a variation of the famous \"Barber Paradox,\" but this particular formulation avoids the logical contradiction that makes the classic version paradoxical."

The barber could choose to visit himself (and thus shave himself) or not visit himself (and handle his own shaving however he wishes).\n\nYou might be thinking of the classic \"Barber Paradox\" which asks about a barber who \"shaves all and only those men who do not shave themselves\" - *that* creates a true logical contradiction.

A king decides to show you mercy - he summons you and tells you the rules: 'There are three doors, guarded by a guard that always tells the truth. Two of the doors lead to death. One door leads to escape.' You pick a door. The guard opens another door with certain death. You may change your door. How do you maximize your chances of escape?",

The optimal strategy is to **switch doors**.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n**Initial situation:**\n- You pick 1 door out of 3\n- Probability your door leads to escape: 1/3\n- Probability the escape is behind one of the other 2 doors: 2/3\n\n**After the guard opens a death door:**\n- The guard eliminates one door that leads to death\n- Your original door still has a 1/3 chance of escape\n- But now ALL of the 2/3 probability that was spread across the other two doors gets concentrated into the single remaining unopened door\n\n**The math:**\n- Stay with original choice: 1/3 chance of escape\n- Switch to remaining door: 2/3 chance of escape\n\n**Why this works:**\nThe guard's action doesn't change the fundamental probabilities. Since the guard knows what's behind each door and will always reveal a death door, they're essentially giving you information that consolidates the 2/3 probability into one door.\n\n**Answer: Always switch doors to double your chances of escape from 33% to 67%.**"

The second girl, by savoring her single cup slowly, gave the poison time to fully dissolve from the melting ice.\n\nThis explains why all the drinks were technically \"poisoned\" (they all contained the poisoned ice), but only the person who drank slowly was actually exposed to a lethal dose of the poison."

        "original_response": "When an unstoppable force meets a movable object, the object simply gets moved.\n\nThis is actually straightforward physics - since the object is movable (not immovable), there's no paradox or contradiction. The unstoppable force would accelerate the movable object according to Newton's second law (F = ma). The object would move in the direction of the applied force, with its acceleration depending on the force's magnitude and the object's mass.\n\nThis differs from the classic philosophical paradox \"What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?\" - which creates a logical contradiction between two absolute concepts. In your version, since the object can be moved, the force simply does what forces do: it moves objects."

Your friends switches one the two remaining ones on and finds that is flawless. Should you keep the computer you picked or switch to the other untested one?",
        "original_response": "Looking at this problem, I can see it's a variant of the famous Monty Hall problem. Let me work through the logic:\n\n**Initial situation:**\n- 3 computers total, exactly 1 is defective\n- You pick 1 computer \n- Probability your computer is defective: 1/3\n- Probability the defective computer is among the other 2: 2/3\n\n**After your friend tests one of the remaining computers:**\n- Your friend tests one of the 2 remaining computers and finds it works perfectly\n- This eliminates that computer as the defective one\n- The 2/3 probability that was distributed between the 2 remaining computers now concentrates entirely on the single untested computer\n\n**Conclusion: You should switch.**\n\nYour original computer still has a 1/3 probability of being defective (this hasn't changed). The untested computer now has a 2/3 probability of being the working one you want.\n\n**Key insight:** Just like in the Monty Hall problem, revealing information about one of the unchosen options doesn't change the probability of your original choice, but it does concentrate the probability onto the remaining alternative.\n\nThe math works out the same whether your friend knew which computer was defective beforehand or just happened to test a working one - either way, you're better off switching to the untested computer."

        "original_response": "Looking at this problem, I can see it's similar to the classic Monty Hall problem, but with an important twist.\n\nLet me analyze this step by step:\n\n**Initial situation:**\n- 3 computers total: 1 defective, 2 working\n- I pick 1 computer\n- Probability my computer is defective: 1/3\n- Probability my computer is working: 2/3\n\n**After my friend's test:**\nMy friend tests one of the remaining two computers and finds it's working.

Since exactly one computer among the remaining three is defective, and I have no additional information to distinguish between them, each of the three remaining computers has an equal probability of being the defective one.\n\nTherefore:\n- P(my computer is defective) = 1/3\n- P(my computer is working) = 2/3\n\n**If I Switch:**\nIf I switch, I randomly get one of the 2 remaining computers.
