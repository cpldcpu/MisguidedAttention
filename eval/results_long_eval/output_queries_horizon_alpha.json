        "Yes.\n\nRationale: Pulling the lever minimizes total harm by sacrificing one to prevent five deaths, aligning with the moral principle of reducing overall loss of life. While it involves actively causing harm to one, the outcome preserves more lives and is often justified under consequentialist reasoning. However, this remains a tragic choice with moral weight and reasonable disagreement.",

It treats all lives as equal in moral worth and chooses the action that results in the fewest deaths, given the constrained options. While it involves actively causing harm to one, the alternative passively allows five to die; in this dilemma, minimizing loss of life is the ethically stronger choice.",
        "Yes. Diverting the trolley minimizes total harm by saving five lives at the cost of one, aligning with a utilitarian principle of reducing overall loss of life.

        "Yes.\n\nIf the dead people are already deceased and cannot be harmed further, diverting the trolley to the track with one living person minimizes loss of life. The moral aim is to prevent additional deaths; allowing the trolley to continue would result in five preventable deaths, whereas diverting it risks one.

From that point, 15 minutes remain.\n- Now count backward: If instead you want exactly 20 minutes from the start, light Rope B at one end 10 minutes after starting. Then at the 30-minute mark (when A finishes), light the other end of B. From that moment, B has 15 minutes left, so total time from start is 30 + 15 = 45. But since you delayed B\u2019s initial lighting by 10 minutes, the interval from when you lit B initially to when it finishes is 35 minutes. The first 20 minutes from the start occurs exactly when B has burned for 10 minutes before the flip plus 10 minutes after the flip\u2014this is convoluted.\n\nCleaner standard solution for exactly 20 minutes with two ropes:\n1) Light Rope A at both ends and Rope B at one end simultaneously.\n2) When Rope A finishes (30 minutes), immediately light the other end of Rope B. It will finish 15 minutes later, i.e., 45 minutes from the start.\n3) To measure 20 minutes, start the procedure 25 minutes before you need the 45-minute event to occur. Practically, with only the ropes, the classic measurable intervals are 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes. Exact 20 minutes is not achievable with only two such uneven ropes.\n\nTherefore, with two uneven 60-minute ropes, you can measure 30, 15, and 45 minutes, but not exactly 20 minutes."

You don't know what's behind any of the doors. You get to choose one door. Let's say you pick Door #1. The host, Monty Hall, who knows what's behind all the doors, opens Door #1, and reveals a goat. Now, you have two doors left: Door #3 and Door #2. You pick Door #3. Monty gives you a choice: you can either stick with your original pick, Door #3, or switch to Door #2.",

After Monty reveals a goat behind your original choice, that entire 2/3 probability effectively transfers to the remaining unopened door. So switching gives you a 2/3 chance to win, while sticking is 1/3. This remains true even though you later said \u201cpick Door #3\u201d; the optimal move at Monty\u2019s final offer is to switch to the other unopened door.",

Since Monty always reveals a goat and never opens the door with the car, the probability mass shifts to the other unopened door. So you should switch.",
        "Switch to Door #2.\n\nExplanation: After Monty reveals a goat (and he always reveals a goat), your initial choice had a 1/3 chance of being the car and the other unopened door now has a 2/3 chance. Switching doubles your odds of winning from 1/3 to 2/3.",

The prisoner\u2019s deduction was flawed, so when the executioner arrived on Friday, it was a genuine surprise to him.\n\nExplanation (brief): The backward-induction argument assumes that if Friday were the only remaining day, the prisoner would know it in advance, contradicting the \u201csurprise\u201d condition.

When the executioner arrives on Friday, it violates his expectation, so it is a surprise. The paradox hinges on the prisoner\u2019s inference undermining the very knowledge needed to eliminate Friday.",

When he\u2019s told on Monday that the hanging will be this week and a surprise, he believes (incorrectly) that a Friday hanging is impossible. Thus, when the executioner arrives on Friday, it is indeed a surprise to him. This resolves the paradox: the surprise is maintained precisely because the prisoner\u2019s reasoning leads him to rule out the actual day.",
        "Yes. His backward deduction led him to believe a Friday execution was impossible, so when it happened on Friday, it was a surprise. The paradox shows that the \u201cno surprise\u201d reasoning is self-defeating: once he rules out all days, he expects no execution, making any actual execution unexpected."

Therefore the correct minimal is 19, not 17, unless the bridge allows four at once without torch returns. If all must have the torch, 17 is not achievable. The optimal is 19:\n- A and B cross (3), A back (1) = 4\n- C and D cross (10) = 14\n- B back (3) = 17\n- A and B cross (3) = 20 \u2014 actually 20 with this ordering.\nThe true optimal 19:\n- A and C cross (5), A back (1) = 6\n- A and D cross (10) = 16\n- A back (1) = 17\n- A and B cross (3) = 20 \u2014 still 20.\n\nBest known optimal is 19:\n- A and B cross (3), B back (3) = 6\n- C and D cross (10) = 16\n- A back (1) = 17\n- A and B cross (3) = 20 \u2014 still 20.\n\nConclusion: With times 1,3,5,10 and one torch, the minimal total is 17 only if the bridge supports two at a time.

        "It sounds like you\u2019re remixing the classic river-crossing puzzle into a playful detective story. In real life, helping someone \u201cgather evidence\u201d must be lawful and avoid entrapment or facilitating harm. Here\u2019s a safe, story-friendly approach:\n\n1) Coordinate with the detective: The farmer should confirm the detective\u2019s plan with proper authorities and follow their instructions.\n\n2) Create a harmless, controlled setup: Arrange a situation where the wolf and goat (the food-business partners) naturally discuss or reveal their practices\u2014e.g., invite them to plan a delivery or talk through sourcing while the detective (the \u201ccabbage\u201d) is present and legally recording.\n\n3) Maintain safety and legality: The farmer doesn\u2019t encourage or induce any wrongdoing\u2014only provides normal conditions (a meeting, a transport, a routine day\u2019s work) where existing misconduct might surface.\n\n4) Document neutrally: Keep logs of dates, times, and observations, and preserve any communications the farmer legitimately receives (texts, invoices). Don\u2019t tamper with or stage evidence.\n\n5) Use witnesses and oversight: If possible, have additional lawful observers or devices authorized by law enforcement to corroborate what\u2019s said or done.\n\n6) Handover and discretion: Share findings directly with authorities; don\u2019t confront the suspects or spread accusations.\n\nThis preserves the spirit of the puzzle\u2019s cast while ensuring ethical, legal evidence-gathering. If you want a whimsical river-crossing twist: the farmer ferries the cabbage-detective with each party in turn for separate chats\u2014first with the wolf, then the goat\u2014so the detective can hear their stories independently without risk or coercion.",
        "This sounds like a playful twist on the classic river-crossing puzzle. If we keep the core constraint (someone can\u2019t be left with their preferred \u201cfood\u201d without supervision), we can reinterpret it for the detective\u2019s sting operation:\n\nGoal: Let the cabbage-detective secretly observe any attempted theft while preventing actual harm. The farmer acts as both transporter and lookout.\n\nPlan:\n1) Equip the cabbage (detective) with a hidden recorder or tracker so it can capture conversations and attempts to steal.\n2) Control proximity like in the original puzzle to create opportunities for incriminating behavior without allowing damage:\n   - First trip: Take the goat across, leaving wolf and cabbage together (they won\u2019t harm each other).\n   - Return alone.\n   - Second trip: Take the wolf across.\n   - Bring the goat back (so the wolf is now across without the goat).\n   - Third trip: Take the cabbage across, leaving the goat temporarily alone on the original side.\n   - Return alone.\n   - Final trip: Bring the goat across.\n\nWhy this helps the detective:\n- The farmer ensures the goat and cabbage are never left unsupervised together long enough for real \u201ceating,\u201d but arranges moments where the wolf and goat can talk business or show intent when the farmer steps away to ferry others.\n- The hidden recorder on the cabbage captures conversations during the brief pairings:\n  - Wolf with cabbage at the start.\n  - Wolf alone at the far bank when goat is taken back.\n  - Goat with cabbage when the farmer ferries others.\n- The farmer can also \u201cforget\u201d a tempting item (like a marked sample of produce) near the cabbage during these pairings to see who tries to take it.\n\nEvidence handling:\n- Time-stamped recordings of conversations.\n- Photos/video from a concealed camera in the cabbage\u2019s basket.\n- A bait tag (RFID/UV dye) on produce to log unauthorized handling.\n- Farmer keeps a log of who was left with whom and when, and preserves chain of custody for any evidence.\n\nThis preserves safety, creates controlled windows for incriminating actions or admissions, and provides the cabbage-detective with usable evidence.",
        "It sounds like you\u2019re blending the classic river-crossing puzzle with a playful story twist. In the standard puzzle, the farmer must ferry items across without leaving the wolf alone with the goat or the goat alone with the cabbage. In your scenario, the cabbage is an undercover detective and wants to gather evidence on the wolf and goat\u2019s food operation.\n\nA fun, puzzle-consistent way to \u201chelp the detective\u201d is to arrange crossings that let the cabbage observe interactions without getting \u201ceaten,\u201d while the farmer maintains plausible deniability. One possible sequence:\n\n1) Take the goat across first and leave it there.\n2) Return alone, take the cabbage across next, and leave it with the goat briefly \u201cto hear their plans,\u201d but immediately bring the goat back with you to avoid the classic problem.\n3) Leave the goat on the original side, take the wolf across to the cabbage so the detective can observe the wolf\u2019s side of the operation.\n4) Return alone and bring the goat last.\n\nThroughout, the cabbage gets time on both banks with each party, gathering \u201cevidence,\u201d while the farmer prevents any mishaps. If you want to lean into the detective theme, the farmer could also:\n- Let the cabbage \u201cride\u201d in the boat bag or basket to overhear conversations during crossings.\n- Stage brief, safe moments where the cabbage is left with either the wolf or the goat to prompt them to talk about their business.\n- Keep rotating who\u2019s left with whom so the detective can compare stories.\n\nThis preserves the logic of the puzzle while giving the undercover cabbage the best chance to collect intel.",
        "Since this is a playful twist on the classic river-crossing puzzle, treat the crossings as a sting operation. The goal is to isolate the suspects (wolf and goat) with opportunities to incriminate themselves while keeping the detective (cabbage) safe and present to observe.\n\nPlan:\n1) Establish the rule: The farmer never leaves the detective alone with anyone who might \u201cspoil\u201d the operation (i.e., no one harms the cabbage, and the detective stays within earshot when evidence is likely).\n2) First crossing: Take the goat across, leaving the wolf and cabbage together. In this version, they\u2019re safe together, and it separates the goat to encourage conversation later.\n3) Return alone, bring the wolf across next to the goat to prompt business talk or planning.\n4) Bring the goat back with the farmer, leaving the wolf on the far side\u2014now the detective can later be positioned with the wolf to overhear.\n5) Take the cabbage (detective) across to the wolf. This puts the detective with a prime suspect to gather intel without risk.\n6) Return alone and finally bring the goat across.\n\nThroughout, the farmer positions the cabbage on the same bank as the most talkative suspect when the farmer is away, creating windows for the detective to listen, observe exchanges, or record conversations. The farmer can also:\n- Plant marked cash or a tagged vegetable crate as bait to trace illicit sales.\n- Use prearranged phrases to prompt suspects to discuss sourcing or buyers.\n- Ensure the detective has a hidden recorder or signal plan.\n\nThis preserves safety and maximizes time where the detective can observe the wolf and goat\u2019s business dealings without interference.",
        "It sounds like you\u2019re remixing the classic river-crossing riddle into a story. If the goal is to help the detective cabbage gather evidence about potential theft, here\u2019s a playful, nonviolent, and safe approach within the story\u2019s logic:\n\n1) Gain trust and separate roles: The farmer discreetly tells the cabbage detective the plan, then casually asks the wolf and goat about their business operations, supplies, and recent \u201cvegetable acquisitions,\u201d framing it as friendly small talk to keep them comfortable.\n\n2) Create controlled situations: The farmer ferries them across in an order that allows the cabbage to overhear candid conversations. For example, briefly leave the wolf and goat together on a bank (with the cabbage hidden nearby in the boat or behind gear) so they speak freely about procurement or any shady deals, knowing the farmer is \u201cout of earshot.\u201d\n\n3) Elicit details: The farmer asks innocuous follow-up questions\u2014who their suppliers are, how they keep costs low, and how they handle surplus\u2014then compares answers from wolf and goat separately, noting inconsistencies.\n\n4) Gather physical evidence: The farmer checks their packs, receipts, or ledgers under the pretense of helping balance inventory for the river crossing. He documents anything suspicious (e.g., mismatched quantities, missing invoices) and notes locations, dates, and names.\n\n5) Corroborate: The farmer quietly arranges to meet a known honest vendor on the far bank to verify claims or to confirm whether produce went missing. The cabbage detective listens in and takes notes.\n\n6) Keep everyone safe: The farmer never leaves the cabbage alone with the wolf and goat if that would put the cabbage at risk. He ensures the detective remains \u201cjust another vegetable\u201d in plain sight, while the real evidence comes from conversation, documents, and third-party verification.\n\n7) Preserve and report: The farmer records times, statements, and items found, then helps the cabbage detective pass the compiled evidence to the proper authorities once the crossing is done.\n\nThis way, the farmer uses social engineering, controlled separation, and documentation to help the undercover cabbage gather solid, non-entrapped evidence without escalating conflict."

      "prompt": "Your friend wants to gift a computer to you. He has four identically looking ones, but knows that one of them is defective. You pick one. Your friends switches one the three remaining ones on and finds that is flawless. Should you keep the computer you picked or switch to another one?",

      "output": [
        "Switch. This is the Monty Hall problem in disguise.\n\nInitially, your chosen computer has a 1/4 chance of being flawless and a 3/4 chance of being defective. Your friend then identifies one flawless computer among the three you didn\u2019t pick and effectively removes it from consideration. That action concentrates the original 3/4 \u201cdefective\u201d probability onto the remaining two unchosen computers.\n\nSince one of those two is now confirmed flawless and out of play, the remaining unchosen computer carries the full 3/4 chance of being flawless, while your original pick still has only a 1/4 chance. So you improve your odds by switching.",
        "Switch to another one.\n\nReason: Initially, the chance your pick is defective is 1/4, so the chance it\u2019s good is 3/4. Your friend then identifies one of the other three as good. Among the remaining two you could switch to, the total probability of containing the bad one is still 3/4 (since your original 1/4 defect chance stays with your pick). Given one of those two is confirmed good, the other untested one now carries the full 3/4 chance of being good. So switching increases your chance of getting a good computer from 3/4? No\u2014correcting: your original pick remains 1/4 good; the single untested alternative becomes 3/4 good. Therefore, you should switch.",
        "Switch. This is a Monty Hall\u2013type problem. Initially, there\u2019s a 1/4 chance your pick is flawless and a 3/4 chance it\u2019s defective. Your friend then turns on one of the other three and finds it flawless (which he can always do unless all remaining are defective, which can\u2019t happen with only one defective total). This extra information shifts probability toward the remaining untested machines.\n\nMore directly: If your initial pick was defective (probability 3/4), then all three others are flawless and your friend can reveal a flawless one, leaving two still-unpicked, both flawless\u2014switching gets you a flawless computer with probability 1 in this branch. If your initial pick was flawless (probability 1/4), switching risks moving to the defective one with probability 1/3 among the others; after revealing a flawless one, there are two unpicked left, one of which is defective, so switching yields a flawless with probability 1/2 in this branch.\n\nOverall probability of getting a flawless computer:\n- If you stay: 1/4.\n- If you switch: (3/4)*1 + (1/4)*(1/2) = 3/4 + 1/8 = 7/8.\n\nSo you should switch.",
        "You should switch.\n\nExplanation: Initially, your pick has a 1/4 chance of being good and 3/4 chance of being bad. Your friend then identifies one of the other three as good, which removes one good option from the remaining pool but doesn\u2019t change your original pick\u2019s odds. Among the two remaining untested computers (yours and one other), the 3/4 probability of the defective one is now concentrated mostly on your original pick. Thus switching gives you a higher chance of getting a good computer (3/4 vs 1/4). This is analogous to the Monty Hall problem.",
        "Switch to another one.\n\nReason: Initially, your chosen computer has a 1/4 chance of being good; the other three collectively have a 3/4 chance. Your friend then identifies one of the remaining three as definitely good and effectively removes it from consideration. The 3/4 chance of the defect being among the other three now concentrates on the two remaining unopened ones, giving each of those a 3/8 chance of being defective and a 5/8 chance of being good. Your original pick still has only a 1/4 (0.25) chance of being good, while switching gives you a 5/8 (0.625) chance\u2014so you should switch. This is analogous to the Monty Hall problem."
