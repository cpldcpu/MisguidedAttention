The probability of this happening is:\n- First person: 365/365 = 1 (can have any birthday)\n- Every other person: 1/365 (must match the first person's birthday)\n\nSo the probability that all 30 people share the same birthday is:\n(1/365)^29 \u2248 1.58 \u00d7 10^-74\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least two people do NOT share the same birthday is:\n1 - (1/365)^29 \u2248 0.9999...9 \u2248 1\n\nThe answer is virtually 1 (or 100%).\n\nNote: If the intended question was about the probability that at least two people DO share a birthday (the classic birthday paradox), that would be approximately 0.706 or 70.6%."

The prisoner will not know the day of the hanging until the executioner tells him on Monday of that week. The prisoner deduces that he will never be hanged by surprise.

        "original_response": "# Was the Friday Execution a Surprise?\n\nYes, the execution was a surprise to the prisoner, despite his deduction that claimed to prove he couldn't be surprised.\n\n## Analysis of the Paradox\n\nThe prisoner's reasoning likely went as follows:\n- It can't be Friday, because if I'm still alive Thursday evening, I'd know Friday is the only remaining possibility, so it wouldn't be a surprise.\n- It can't be Thursday, because having ruled out Friday, if I'm alive Wednesday evening, I'd know it must be Thursday.\n- Following this backward chain of reasoning, he rules out Wednesday, Tuesday, and finally Monday.\n- Therefore, he concludes no day could be a surprise.\n\nHowever, this reasoning contains a fundamental flaw. Once the prisoner convinces himself that the hanging cannot occur on any day, he no longer expects it to happen at all. But when the executioner arrives on Friday, this is genuinely surprising to him precisely because he had concluded it was impossible.\n\n## The Self-Defeating Reasoning\n\nThe paradox emerges because the prisoner's conclusion undermines its own premise. By believing he won't be executed on any day, any execution would be unexpected and therefore a surprise - exactly as the judge predicted.\n\nThis is why the Friday execution fulfills the judge's statement: the prisoner, having convinced himself through faulty logic that the execution couldn't happen, was indeed surprised when it did."

Once the prisoner convinced himself that a surprise execution was impossible, he would no longer expect to be executed on any day.\n\n2. Given this belief, when Friday arrived and the execution actually occurred, it genuinely surprised him - precisely because his reasoning had led him to believe it couldn't happen at all.\n\n3.

This same reasoning then eliminates Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesday, and Monday in sequence\n3.

Once he convinces himself that no execution can occur (according to the judge's conditions), any execution would be unexpected and therefore surprising.\n\nWhen Friday arrives and the executioner comes, it contradicts the prisoner's belief system entirely. He had convinced himself through his logical analysis that this scenario was impossible, making the Friday execution genuinely surprising to him.\n\nThis illustrates the self-referential nature of the paradox - the very act of trying to predict the surprise eliminates the prediction and preserves the possibility of surprise."

Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, there's an issue with the wording: it says \"You picked doors 1, 2, and 3\" which would mean selecting all doors. I'll assume this means you're choosing among doors 1, 2, and 3.\n\nIn this scenario:\n- There are 3 doors with a car behind one and goats behind the other two\n- The host opened door 2, revealing a goat\n- You need to decide whether to stick with your initial choice or switch\n\n## The solution:\n\n**Yes, you should change your choice** to whichever door remains unopened (either door 1 or 3, depending on your initial pick).\n\n### Why switching is beneficial:\n- Your initial choice had a 1/3 probability of being correct\n- The remaining unopened door has a 2/3 probability of containing the car\n\nThis works because the host deliberately chose a door with a goat, using their knowledge of what's behind each door. By switching, you take advantage of this additional information that wasn't available when you made your initial choice.\n\nThe strategy of switching increases your chances of winning from 1/3 to 2/3."
