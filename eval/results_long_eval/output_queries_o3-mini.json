        "This is a classic ethical dilemma known as the trolley problem, and there isn\u2019t a single \u201ccorrect\u201d answer\u2014it depends largely on the moral framework one adheres to. \n\nIf you approach the problem from a utilitarian or consequentialist perspective, you might decide to pull the lever since doing so minimizes overall harm by saving five lives at the expense of one. From this point of view, the morally right action is the one that produces the greatest good for the greatest number.\n\nOn the other hand, if you take a deontological perspective (one that emphasizes duties, rules, and the intrinsic rights of individuals), you might argue against pulling the lever because it involves making an active choice to sacrifice an innocent person. According to this view, even though more lives would be lost by not acting, actively intervening could be seen as morally impermissible because it violates a moral rule against killing.\n\nMany people find this dilemma so challenging because it pits a \u201cdo no harm\u201d principle against a utilitarian calculus of saved lives. In reality, different people will have different answers based on their own ethical intuitions and reasoning. \n\nSo, whether you would pull the lever or not depends on the values and reasoning you prioritize.

        "This question is a classic ethical dilemma known as the \u201ctrolley problem,\u201d and there isn\u2019t a universally accepted \u201cright\u201d answer\u2014it depends largely on one's ethical framework.\n\nFor example, if you lean toward utilitarianism\u2014a moral philosophy that emphasizes outcomes and seeks to maximize overall well\u2010being\u2014you might decide to pull the lever. From this perspective, causing the death of one person to save five is justified because it minimizes total harm.\n\nOn the other hand, if you follow a deontological approach\u2014one that focuses on the morality of actions themselves rather than just their consequences\u2014you might argue that intentionally causing harm (in this case, pulling the lever and thereby sacrificing one person) is morally impermissible, regardless of the potential benefits.\n\nMany people struggle with this dilemma because it forces a choice between actively making a decision that directly results in harm versus passively allowing a greater number of harms. In a real-world situation, moral responsibility, emotional factors, and the context of the decision might further complicate the issue.\n\nIn summary, while my personal answer might lean toward pulling the lever under utilitarian reasoning (saving five lives at the expense of one), I fully acknowledge the profound ethical complexities of the scenario. Your own answer may differ depending on how you weigh the responsibilities of action versus inaction and the moral principles you value most.",

Utilitarian View: Many utilitarians would argue that you should pull the lever because doing so saves five lives at the cost of one. They focus on minimizing overall harm or maximizing well-being.\n\n2. Deontological View: Others who follow deontological ethics might say that pulling the lever makes you directly responsible for one person\u2019s death, so it may be better not to interfere with the situation, even though more people would die if you do nothing.\n\nUltimately, the decision depends on your own ethical beliefs and values.

Since each rope burns completely in 60 minutes when lit from one end, you can simply light a single rope at one end; when it has burned completely, exactly 60 minutes will have elapsed.\n\nWhy It Works:\n\u2022 Each rope, regardless of its uneven burn rate, is defined so that lighting it at one end causes it to burn in exactly 60 minutes.\n\u2022 Thus, no trick or combination of ropes is needed\u2014you just use one rope and a match.\n\nAnswer: Light one rope at one end and let it burn completely. When it finishes burning, 60 minutes will have passed.",
        "We can do it in one very simple procedure. Although each rope burns non\u2010uniformly, we do know that no matter how it burns, a rope lit at one end always takes 60 minutes to burn completely and one lit at both ends always takes 30 minutes to burn.\n\nHere\u2019s what to do:\n\n\u2022 At the same moment, light Rope A at both ends and Rope B at one end.\n\n\u2022 Because Rope A is burning from both ends, it will be completely burned in 30 minutes. (It doesn\u2019t matter that its burning is uneven\u2014lighting both ends always halves the total time.)\n\n\u2022 Meanwhile Rope B, lit only at one end, burns for a full 60 minutes. But by the time Rope A burns out (after 30 minutes), Rope B has been burning for 30 minutes\u2014so it has exactly 30 minutes of burn time left.\n\n\u2022 Simply let Rope B continue to burn. When Rope B finishes burning, exactly 60 minutes will have elapsed since you started.\n\nThus, by this method you\u2019ve used the ropes and matches as your only timing device to measure exactly 60 minutes."

Now, you have two doors left: Door #3 and Door #2. You pick Door #3. Monty gives you a choice: you can either stick with your original pick, Door #3, or switch to Door #2.",

After you choose Door #1, the host, who knows what\u2019s behind every door, deliberately opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat. This action does not change the initial probabilities.\n3. With one door showing a goat and removed from contention, the 2/3 probability that the car is behind one of the two doors is now concentrated on the other unopened door (in this case, Door #2).\n\nSo, if you stick with your current pick (Door #3), you win only if your initial choice was correct\u2014which was a 1/3 chance. Switching to Door #2 gives you the full 2/3 chance.\n\nThus, the best strategy is to switch to Door #2.",

At the start, you have a 1 in 3 chance (1/3) of picking the car and a 2 in 3 chance (2/3) that the car is behind one of the other two doors.\n\n2. Monty Hall, who knows where the car is, always reveals a door with a goat. His action isn\u2019t random\u2014it\u2019s designed to give you some extra information. In the typical Monty Hall problem, if your initial choice was wrong (which happens 2/3 of the time), the remaining unopened door will be the one with the car.\n\n3. Even though this scenario\u2019s door numbering seems a bit unusual (Monty apparently opened Door #1 after your pick), the core idea remains: switching doors leverages the higher probability (2/3) that you initially picked a goat.\n\nSo if you switch from Door #3 to Door #2, you maximize your chances of winning the car.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: choose to switch to Door #2.",
        "This puzzle is a version of the famous Monty Hall problem. Under the standard rules of the game, here\u2019s the reasoning:\n\n1. Initially there\u2019s a 1/3 chance that the car is behind each door.\n2. You first choose Door #1. This means there\u2019s a 1/3 chance the car is behind Door #1 and a combined 2/3 chance that the car is behind one of the other doors (Door #2 or Door #3).\n3. The host, who knows what is behind every door, then opens one of the doors with a goat. In this scenario, he opens Door #1 (your original choice) and shows a goat. (Normally, Monty never opens the door the contestant originally picks; the twist here is simply a change in numbering, but the underlying probability analysis remains the same.)\n4. Now, with two doors left (Door #2 and Door #3), you choose Door #3 as your current pick.\n5. Monty then gives you the option to stick with Door #3 or switch to Door #2.\n\nBecause the chance that your original door (which would be Door #1, now revealed to be a goat) was incorrect is 2/3, switching to the other unopened door (in this case, Door #2) gives you a 2/3 chance of winning the car. Sticking with Door #3 would give you only a 1/3 chance.\n\nSo, the best strategy is to switch to Door #2."

A (1 min) and B (3 min) cross together \u2013 taking 3 minutes.\n2. A (1 min) returns with the torch \u2013 now the total is 4 minutes.\n3.

In every solution the torch must be brought back by someone (adding extra trips).\n\nA common \u201coptimal\u201d strategy is:\n\n1. A and B cross together \u2192 takes 3 minutes.\n2. A returns with the torch \u2192 takes 1 minute.    (Total 4 minutes)\n3. C and D cross together \u2192 takes 10 minutes.   (Total 14 minutes)\n4. B returns with the torch \u2192 takes 3 minutes.   (Total 17 minutes)\n5. A and B cross together again \u2192 takes 3 minutes. (Total = 20 minutes)\n\nThis plan totals 20 minutes.

        "There\u2019s a famous \u201cbridge\u2010and\u2010torch\u201d puzzle with four people having speeds of 1, 3, 5 and 10 minutes. In the usual version only two people can cross at a time, and the \u201coptimal\u201d plan is often given as follows:\n\n 1. Persons A (1 min) and B (3 min) cross together \u2192 takes 3 minutes.\n 2. Person A returns with the torch \u2192 +1 minute (total 4 minutes).\n 3. Persons C (5 min) and D (10 min) cross together \u2192 +10 minutes (total 14 minutes).\n 4. Person B returns with the torch \u2192 +3 minutes (total 17 minutes).\n 5. Finally, A and B cross together again \u2192 +3 minutes (total 20 minutes).\n\nEven though step 4 brings the elapsed time to 17 minutes, the final crossing makes the overall time 20 minutes. In other words, under the standard rules (only two people can cross at once, and a pair moves at the rate of the slower one) it turns out that no sequence of crossings will get everyone over in 17 minutes or less\u2014the minimum possible is 20 minutes.\n\nNote that some versions of this puzzle use slightly different numbers (for example, 1, 2, 5 and 10 minutes) in which case a 17\u2010minute solution is possible. But with times 1, 3, 5 and 10 minutes the answer is: \n\n They cannot all cross within 17 minutes; the best strategy takes 20 minutes.",
        "We can solve the puzzle in under 17 minutes\u2014but only if we take advantage of the fact that the bridge can support up to four people at a time. (Many \u201cbridge\u2010and\u2010torch\u201d puzzles restrict the crossing to two people at a time, in which case with these speeds it takes 20 minutes; here the extra capacity lets us do better.)\n\nHere are the people and their individual crossing times:\n \u2022 A: 1 minute\n \u2022 B: 3 minutes\n \u2022 C: 5 minutes\n \u2022 D: 10 minutes\n\nBecause the bridge can hold three (or even four) people at once, we are allowed to have more than a pair cross at a time. When several people cross together, they must move at the pace of the slowest of them.\n\nOne very efficient solution is as follows:\n\nStep 1. Have A, C, and D cross together.\n  \u2013 Their crossing time is determined by the slowest \u2013 D takes 10 minutes.\n   (Time so far: 10 minutes)\n  After this step, A, C, and D are across; B remains on the starting side, and the torch is now on the far side.\n\nStep 2. Have A return with the torch.\n  \u2013 A takes just 1 minute.\n   (Time so far: 10 + 1 = 11 minutes)\n  After this, A and B are together on the original side, while C and D remain across.\n\nStep 3. Have A and B cross together.\n  \u2013 Their crossing time is determined by B (3 minutes).\n   (Time for this trip: 3 minutes)\n   (Total time: 11 + 3 = 14 minutes)\n\nAt the end, all four people are on the far side and the total elapsed time is 14 minutes, which is well under the 17\u2010minute limit.\n\nThus, by letting three of the party (including the two slowest) cross together, and having A (the fastest) handle the returns, the puzzle is solved in 14 minutes.",

(This move ensures that the undercover cabbage\u2013detective can safely observe the wolf\u2019s behavior without its conspiring partner being present to cover for him.)  \n5. Now, on the original bank, the farmer leaves the goat and ferries the cabbage (our undercover detective) across the river. At this point the cabbage detective \u2013 safe on the far bank \u2013 is in a good position to gather evidence against the wolf\u2019s shady deals.  \n6. Finally, the farmer goes back one last time to retrieve the goat and brings it across.\n\nBy carefully transporting the animals and the \u201cdetective cabbage\u201d in this order, the farmer ensures that his undercover friend is kept secure and in a precise environment to do its job: record what the wolf and goat might be up to. In short, this step\u2010by\u2010step strategy allows the cabbage detective to be on the scene without interference from its potentially compromising partners, thus helping gather damning evidence of the vegetable theft ring.",
        "The twist in this version is that the detective is actually the cabbage\u2014and the wolf and the goat, though best friends running a food business, are suspects in vegetable theft! The farmer\u2019s job is to make sure that the undercover detective (the cabbage) isn\u2019t \u201cattacked\u201d by a hungry goat or otherwise compromised, all while transporting everyone safely across the river so the detective can eventually gather evidence by having the two potential culprits together.\n\nThe solution follows the same careful sequence as the classic puzzle (with one extra twist in the story):\n\n1. First, the farmer takes the goat across the river. (This is because leaving the goat with the cabbage/detective might cause the cabbage to \u201cdisappear\u201d from the investigation\u2014just as in the original, you never leave goat and cabbage together unattended.)\n\n2. The farmer then returns alone to the original bank. Now the wolf and the cabbage (our undercover detective) are left together. In this twist, that\u2019s acceptable because the wolf isn\u2019t a threat to an intelligent detective veggie\u2014and besides, the wolf is one of the potential suspects, not someone to be immediately \u201ceaten\u201d or interfered with.\n\n3. Next, the farmer ferries the cabbage/detective to the far bank where the goat is. (Now the detective is with one of the suspects\u2014but remember, the goat had already left the cabbage alone, and we want to avoid any situation where the detective might \u201close its evidence.\u201d)\n\n4. However, having left the wolf on the original bank, the farmer now brings the goat back with him. (This move prevents the goat and cabbage from being left together unsupervised on the far bank, which might let the goat interfere with the detective\u2019s undercover work.)\n\n5. The farmer then takes the wolf across the river. (This delivers one suspect\u2014the food-business running wolf\u2014into the same area as the cabbage detective, so that later the detective can glean evidence from both conspirators.)\n\n6. Finally, the farmer returns one last time to pick up the goat and brings it over to the far bank. (Now all three\u2014the wolf, the goat, and the undercover cabbage detective\u2014are safely together.)\n\nAt this point, the cabbage (our undercover detective) is on the same side as both the wolf and the goat. With everyone in one place and no chance for mishaps during the transport, the detective can begin gathering evidence about the vegetable theft by questioning or observing the two potential criminals.\n\nThus, by following the classic crossing strategy (goat first, then detective with a return of the goat, then wolf, and finally goat again), the farmer not only ensures a safe passage across the river but also creates the perfect \u201cinterrogation\u201d scene for the undercover cabbage detective to gather the evidence needed against its duplicitous companions.",
        "Here's one playful solution that adapts the classic puzzle to our quirky cast:\n\nStep 1. The farmer uses his boat to shuttle the goat across the river first. In this version the goat is busy \u201crunning the food business\u201d with the wolf, so by moving it first the farmer avoids any premature vegetable mishaps near the undercover detective (the cabbage).\n\nStep 2. The farmer goes back alone and then ferries the cabbage (our undercover detective) over next. Now the detective is safely on the far bank where she can start looking around for clues about any vegetable theft, without the goat nibbling on her undercover cover.\n\nStep 3. To keep the detective from being \u201ctainted\u201d by too much proximity to her co\u2013conspirators (even though the wolf and goat are best buddies), the farmer then brings the goat back with him on the return trip.\n\nStep 4. Next, he transports the wolf across the river. Since the wolf and goat are business partners who get along fine, leaving them together doesn\u2019t pose a risk. Moreover, with the detective (cabbage) already in place, the suspects can\u2019t cover up their trail.\n\nStep 5. Finally, the farmer returns one last time to pick up the goat and reunite all parties on the other side. Now everyone\u2014the wolf, the goat, and the undercover detective cabbage\u2014is on the far bank with the farmer.\n\nWith the suspects and the sleuth together, the detective cabbage can now gather evidence (and maybe even interrogate her veggie co\u2013conspirators) to crack the case of the vegetable theft, all thanks to the farmer\u2019s careful transport strategy.\n\nIn short, by carefully planning the order in which he ferries his unusual passengers across the river, the farmer ensures that the undercover detective (cabbage) is never left in a compromising situation, and thus is in the perfect position to gather the evidence she needs."

        "The correct answer is A.\n\nExplanation:\nAccording to probability theory, when you combine several conditions (a conjunction), the overall probability of the combined statements is never higher than the probability of any single one of those statements. In this case, option A (\u201cLinda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement\u201d) specifies two conditions that Linda must satisfy, while option B (\u201cLinda is a bank teller, active in animal rights, a vegetarian, anti-war, a socialist, and concerned about global poverty\u201d) has all of those conditions plus several additional ones. Therefore, by the rules of probability, the probability of option B is lower than that of option A.\n\nEven in cases like the famous \u201cLinda problem,\u201d where our intuitive judgments might be misled by how well the description fits certain stereotypes, the formal rules of probability dictate that a conjunction of events (one event and another) is always less likely than any one event considered on its own.\n\nThus, option A is more likely than option B.",
        "The answer is A.\n\nHere's why: Although Linda\u2019s background might make it easy to assume she's involved in social activism (which tempts many to pick option B), the rules of probability dictate that adding additional specific conditions (as in option B) makes the overall probability lower than a less restrictive scenario (as in option A). Even if Linda has traits that one might associate with a strong activist, the conjunction probability\u2014that is, the probability of multiple events all occurring together\u2014is always less than or equal to the probability of any single one of those events happening on its own.\n\nTherefore, option A (Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement) is more likely than option B, which adds even more conditions.",
        "The correct answer is A.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen comparing the probability of two events, adding extra details (conditions) to an event generally makes it less likely\u2014even if the extra details seem to fit someone\u2019s personality. In this problem, both options involve Linda being a bank teller. However, option B adds several extra conditions (active in animal rights, vegetarian, anti-war, a socialist, and concerned about global poverty), making it a more specific (and therefore less likely) scenario than option A. According to the rules of probability, the likelihood of a conjunction of several independent details (i.e., events happening together) is less than or equal to the likelihood of a single one of those events. Thus, even if Linda\u2019s background makes her seem like an activist, option A (bank teller and active in the feminist movement) is more probable than option B (bank teller plus several additional activist credentials).\n\nSo, based on probability theory, option A is the correct answer."

So you should change your choice.",
        "This is just the classic Monty Hall problem. (Note that \u201cdoors 1, 2, and 3\u201d means there are three doors available to choose from.) You initially pick one door (say door 1).

        "We start with one pair of rabbits. (In these types of puzzles \u201cone rabbit\u201d really means \u201cone pair\u201d because the problem is phrased in terms of \u201ca pair of rabbits.\u201d)\n\nThe rule is: every pair of rabbits that is two years old or older produces (gives birth to) two baby rabbits per year. (Since \u201ctwo baby rabbits\u201d form one new pair, you can think of it as each mature pair producing one new pair each year.)\n\nLet F(n) be the number of rabbit pairs at the end of year n. Because only pairs that are at least 2 years old produce a new pair, the sequence develops as follows:\n\n\u2022 Year 0: F(0) = 1 pair (the starting pair, not yet mature)  \n\u2022 Year 1: F(1) = 1 pair (still not mature \u2192 no reproduction)  \n\u2022 Year 2: The original pair becomes 2 years old and produces a new pair. So, F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 1 = 2 pairs.  \n\u2022 Year 3: Only the original pair (now 3 years old) is mature enough to breed, so it produces one new pair. Then F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 2 + 1 = 3 pairs.  \n\u2022 Year 4: Now the original pair and the pair born in Year 2 are mature. They produce 2 new pairs (one each). Thus, F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 3 + 2 = 5 pairs.  \n\u2022 Year 5: The mature pairs are those from Year 3 and earlier (three pairs total). They produce 3 new pairs. So, F(5) = F(4) + F(3) = 5 + 3 = 8 pairs.  \n\u2022 Year 6: The mature pairs are now F(4) pairs (those born in Year 4 and earlier) which is 5 pairs. They produce 5 new pairs, so F(6) = F(5) + F(4) = 8 + 5 = 13 pairs.  \n\u2022 Year 7: The mature pairs are F(5) in number (those born in Year 5 and earlier) which is 8 pairs. They produce 8 new pairs, so F(7) = F(6) + F(5) = 13 + 8 = 21 pairs.\n\nThus, after 7 years there will be 21 pairs of rabbits. (In other words, if you count individual rabbits, that would be 42 rabbits; however, the puzzle is usually understood in terms of pairs.) \n\nAnswer: 21 pairs.",
        "The idea behind the puzzle is based on the Fibonacci\u2010like reproduction process. (Note that strictly speaking, if rabbits must be in pairs to reproduce, \u201cone rabbit\u201d can be interpreted as \u201cone pair.\u201d For the purpose of the problem we assume you start with one pair of rabbits.)\n\nHere\u2019s how the reproduction works:\n\u2022 A pair of rabbits does not reproduce until it is two years old.\n\u2022 Every year after that, each pair produces two baby rabbits (which form a new pair).\n\nWe can let a(n) be the number of rabbit pairs present in year n. Initially, at year 1, you have one pair:\n  a(1) = 1\n\nIn year 2 the original pair is still too young to reproduce:\n  a(2) = 1\n\nStarting in year 3, the process follows this rule:\n  a(n) = a(n \u2013 1) + a(n \u2013 2)\nbecause each pair that is at least two years old (which is exactly the pairs that existed two years earlier) produces a new pair.\n\nNow we compute year by year:\n\u2022 Year 1: a(1) = 1 pair\n\u2022 Year 2: a(2) = 1 pair\n\u2022 Year 3: a(3) = a(2) + a(1) = 1 + 1 = 2 pairs\n\u2022 Year 4: a(4) = a(3) + a(2) = 2 + 1 = 3 pairs\n\u2022 Year 5: a(5) = a(4) + a(3) = 3 + 2 = 5 pairs\n\u2022 Year 6: a(6) = a(5) + a(4) = 5 + 3 = 8 pairs\n\u2022 Year 7: a(7) = a(6) + a(5) = 8 + 5 = 13 pairs\n\nHowever, note that in this version each pair produces a new pair every year (i.e. \u201ctwo baby rabbits\u201d form one pair), so there is an alternative interpretation:\nSome formulations define the reproduction process so that at year 3 the initial pair is now reproducing, giving:\n  Year 1: 1 pair\n  Year 2: 1 pair\n  Year 3: 1 (existing) + 1 (new) = 2 pairs\n  Year 4: 2 (existing) + 1 (the pair from Year 1 now reproduces) = 3 pairs\n  Year 5: 3 (existing) + 2 (pairs from Year 2 reproduce) = 5 pairs\n  Year 6: 5 (existing) + 3 (pairs from Year 3 reproduce) = 8 pairs\n  Year 7: 8 (existing) + 5 (pairs from Year 4 reproduce) = 13 pairs\n\nIn either case, if you count rabbits individually (each pair consists of 2 rabbits), then after 7 years you have:\n  13 pairs \u00d7 2 rabbits/pair = 26 rabbits\n\nOn the other hand, some versions of the puzzle use the recurrence starting from:\n  Year 1: 1 pair,\n  Year 2: 1 pair,\n  Year 3: 2 pairs,\n  Year 4: 3 pairs,\n  Year 5: 5 pairs,\n  Year 6: 8 pairs,\n  Year 7: 13 pairs,\n  Year 8: 21 pairs\nso that after 7 full years (counting the start as year 0) you end up with 21 pairs (or 42 rabbits).\n\nBecause the wording \u201cfrom two years after birth\u201d can be interpreted in two slightly different ways depending on whether the initial year counts before or after reaching the age for reproduction, there are two common answers:\n \u2022 Interpreting \u201c7 years\u201d to mean that you count from Year 1 up to Year 7 (with the first reproduction happening in Year 3), you get 13 pairs, which is 26 rabbits.\n \u2022 Interpreting \u201c7 years\u201d as having 7 complete breeding cycles (starting with an initial immature pair, then 7 full transitions of the form a(n) = a(n \u2013 1) + a(n \u2013 2)) you get 21 pairs, which is 42 rabbits.\n\nMany classic puzzles of this type assume that the initial pair is counted as \u201c1\u201d at the start (year 0) so that after 7 years you have 21 pairs. \n\nBecause the wording \u201cif you had one rabbit\u201d might be a misstatement (since a pair is needed to reproduce) the commonly accepted answer follows the Fibonacci pattern yielding 21 pairs. \n\nThus, if you interpret the problem as starting with one pair (two rabbits) and after 7 years you have 21 pairs, then in terms of individual rabbits the answer is:\n  21 pairs \u00d7 2 rabbits per pair = 42 rabbits.\n\nAnswer: 42 rabbits.",
        "We start with one pair of baby rabbits. (Often the puzzle is stated \u201cif you had one pair...\u201d even though the question says \u201cone rabbit\u201d, it really means one breeding pair.) The rule is that every pair of rabbits that is at least 2 years old produces a new pair each year. This means that a pair does not reproduce until its second year and then reproduces every year thereafter. \n\nLet f(n) be the number of pairs at the end of year n. Then we have:\n\n  \u2022 f(1) = 1      (the original pair, too young to breed)\n  \u2022 f(2) = 1      (the original pair turns 2 and will start breeding the next year)\n  \u2022 For n \u2265 3, every pair that is 2 years old or older (i.e. all the pairs that were present two years earlier) will produce a new pair. Thus, each year the number of new pairs equals f(n\u20132). Also, the pairs from the previous year all remain. So we have:\n\n    f(n) = f(n\u20131) + f(n\u20132).\n\nThis is exactly the Fibonacci recurrence.\n\nNow, let\u2019s compute f(n) for n = 1 to 7:\n\n  Year 1: f(1) = 1  \n  Year 2: f(2) = 1  \n  Year 3: f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2  \n  Year 4: f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3  \n  Year 5: f(5) = f(4) + f(3) = 3 + 2 = 5  \n  Year 6: f(6) = f(5) + f(4) = 5 + 3 = 8  \n  Year 7: f(7) = f(6) + f(5) = 8 + 5 = 13\n\nThus, by the end of the 7th year, there are 13 pairs of rabbits.\n\nSince each pair consists of two rabbits, if you wish to know the total number of individual rabbits it would be 13 pairs \u00d7 2 = 26 rabbits.\n\nAnswer: There will be 13 pairs of rabbits (or 26 rabbits in total) in 7 years."

After that, there are two unopened boxes left aside from the contestant\u2019s original choice.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the two options:\n\n1. Sticking with the original box:  \n \u2022 Initially, there was a 75% chance it was good, and nothing the host did changes this. So by keeping it, you have a 75% chance of a good appliance.\n\n2.

Suppose that exactly one of the four appliances is defective (the host\u2019s announcement \u201cone of the appliances may be defective\u201d strongly hints this is the case). That means that three boxes contain flawless appliances and one box contains a defective one.\n\nStep 1. Before any boxes are opened, when the contestant picks a box the chance that it is flawless is 3/4 (75%) and that it is defective is 1/4 (25%).\n\nStep 2. The host then opens one of the three boxes not chosen by the contestant and shows that the appliance inside is flawless. Importantly, the host knows what is inside each box and always chooses one that is good. (This is much like the host in Monty Hall always revealing a goat.)\n\nStep 3. Now there remain three boxes: the contestant\u2019s originally chosen box and two unopened boxes. Let us compare the two strategies:\n\n\u2022 If the contestant stays with his original box, his chance of having already chosen a good appliance remains 75%.\n\n\u2022 If instead he decides to switch to one other box (he can only choose one, not both), things become a bit more subtle. Consider the two cases:\n  \u2013 Case A: If his original box was good (probability = 75%), then among the two remaining unopened boxes one of them is defective and the other flawless. Picking one at random gives him a 50% chance of landing on the good box. So in this case the chance of ending up with a good appliance by switching is 0.75 \u00d7 0.5 = 37.5%.\n  \u2013 Case B: If his original box was defective (probability = 25%), then among the two remaining boxes both must be good because the only defective appliance is his. Then if he switches, no matter which of the two he picks he will get a good appliance, contributing 0.25 \u00d7 1 = 25% to the probability.\n  \u2013 Overall, switching gives him a 37.5% + 25% = 62.5% chance of ending up with a flawless appliance.\n\nThus, if the contestant sticks with his original choice he has a 75% chance of getting a good appliance while if he switches (to one other unopened box chosen at random) his chance drops to 62.5%.\n\nSo, the mathematically best strategy is to stick with the original box.\n\nAnswer: The contestant should keep the box he originally picked.",
        "We\u2019re told that among the four boxed appliances exactly one may be defective (so three are flawless), and the contestant initially picks one box at random. Then the host, who knows which appliance is defective, opens one of the other boxes and shows that its product is flawless.\n\nLet\u2019s label the boxes 1 through 4, and suppose the defective appliance is randomly placed, so each box has a 1/4 chance of being defective and a 3/4 chance of being good for the contestant\u2019s choice.\n\nStep 1. Before the host\u2019s action, the probability that the contestant\u2019s box is flawless is 3/4, and the probability it is defective is 1/4.\n\nStep 2. The host then shows one of the remaining boxes to be flawless. Because the host always picks a box that is good, this action does not change the probability that the originally chosen box is good\u2014it remains at 3/4. However, some chance \u201cshifts\u201d to the other boxes if the contestant were to switch. Let\u2019s analyze what happens if the contestant decides to \u201cswitch\u201d by selecting one of the two remaining unopened boxes:\n\n\u2022 Case 1: The contestant\u2019s original box is already good (which happens with probability 3/4). In this case, among the other three boxes one of which has the defective appliance, the host removed one good box. That leaves two boxes, one flawless and one defective. So if the contestant switches and randomly picks one of the two, his chance of getting a good one in this case is 1/2.\n\n\u2022 Case 2: The contestant\u2019s original box is defective (which happens with probability 1/4). In this case, the defective appliance is in the contestant\u2019s box and the remaining three boxes are all good\u2014but the host still shows one good box. That leaves two boxes which are both flawless. So if the contestant switches in this case, he is sure to pick a good appliance (chance = 100%).\n\nNow, if the contestant switches (picking one box at random out of the two remaining unopened), his overall probability of ending up with a flawless appliance is:\n  (Probability original is good) \u00d7 (1/2) + (Probability original is defective) \u00d7 (1)\n  = (3/4)\u00d7(1/2) + (1/4)\u00d7(1)\n  = 3/8 + 1/4\n  = 3/8 + 2/8\n  = 5/8 (or 62.5%).\n\nIf instead the contestant sticks with his original box, his chance remains 3/4 (or 75%) because nothing has altered its original probability.\n\nThus, by sticking with the original box you have a 75% chance of being flawless compared to a 62.5% chance if you switch afterward.\n\nAnswer: The contestant should keep (stick with) the box he originally picked."

        "This puzzle is very similar in style to the Monty Hall problem\u2014even though there are four boxes instead of three, the twist is that one box is \u201crevealed\u201d (or in this case, tested) and shown to be good. However, unlike the standard Monty Hall puzzle where all unopened doors (except your original choice) are \u201cequal\u201d gifts (or goats), here the sales clerk\u2019s box is known to be flawless because he actually tests it.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down:\n\n1. There are four boxes and exactly one appliance is defective (if any).\n\n2. When the customer picks one, his chance that he\u2019s picked the defective appliance is 1 in 4 (25%), and the chance he picked a good one is 3 in 4 (75%).\n\n3. Next, the sales clerk takes one of the other three boxes and tests its appliance. Because he knows which one might be defective, he is able to choose one that is flawless. Hence, the appliance in this tested box is 100% good.\n\n4. At this point there are three \u201coptions\u201d on the counter:\n  a. The customer\u2019s original box (with a 75% chance of being good).\n  b. The tested box (known to be good).\n  c. One other unopened box (whose chance of being good is not as high \u2013 because it is more likely to hide the defective appliance if the customer\u2019s original was good).\n\nThe key is that the tested box is confirmed to be free of defects. Even if the customer\u2019s initial box had a 75% chance of being good, there\u2019s still a 25% chance it\u2019s defective. The unopened box (aside from the clerk\u2010tested box) has an even lower chance of being reliable (you can work out the exact probability, but it turns out to be lower than even 75% if you decide randomly between it and the tested box).\n\nThus, because the tested appliance has been verified to be flawless, the customer maximizes his odds by taking that box.\n\nAnswer: The customer should pick the box that the sales clerk opened and tested.",
        "We start with four boxes, one of which is (possibly) defective. When the customer picks a box at random, there\u2019s a 1 in 4 chance (25%) that it\u2019s defective and a 3 in 4 chance (75%) that it\u2019s good.\n\nThen the clerk, knowing which one might be defective, deliberately opens one of the other boxes\u2014and finds it flawless. This is similar in spirit to the famous Monty Hall problem, but note that there are four boxes instead of three, and the customer is only allowed to pick one box in the end.\n\nLet\u2019s label the boxes A, B, C, and D. Assume the customer initially picks box A.\n\nTwo cases occur:\n\n1. (Case 1) Box A (the chosen one) is the defective appliance. This happens with probability 1/4. In that case, all of boxes B, C, and D are good. The clerk then opens one of these (say box B) that is good. That leaves two unopened boxes (say C and D) \u2013 both are good. If the customer now abandons box A and switches (by picking one of the remaining unopened boxes), he will win for sure in this case.\n\n2. (Case 2) Box A is good. This happens with probability 3/4. Then the defective appliance must be in one of the other three boxes. The clerk, knowing which box is defective, is forced to open one of the remaining boxes that is definitely good. But now among the two unopened boxes (apart from box A) one is defective and one is good. Hence, if the customer switches and picks one of the two remaining boxes at random, he has a 50% chance in this case.\n\nLet\u2019s compare the overall probabilities:\n\n\u2022 If the customer sticks with box A, his chance of having a good appliance is simply the probability that his original pick was good: 75%.\n\n\u2022 If he decides to switch to one randomly chosen unopened box, then:\n \u2013 In Case 1 (1/4 chance), switching gives him a 100% chance of getting a good appliance.\n \u2013 In Case 2 (3/4 chance), switching gives him a 50% chance of getting a good appliance.\nSo, the overall success probability when switching is:\n (1/4 \u00d7 1) + (3/4 \u00d7 1/2) = 1/4 + 3/8 = 5/8 = 62.5%.\n\nSince 75% (if staying) is higher than 62.5% (if switching), the customer maximizes his chance of getting a flawless product by sticking with his original choice.\n\nAnswer: The customer should stick with the box he originally picked.",
        "There are four boxes, one of which is defective (and three are flawless). When the customer first picks a box, there is a 3\u20444 chance that his box is good and a 1\u20444 chance it is the defective one.\n\nThen the sales clerk, who knows which item is faulty, goes to one of the other three boxes and opens it\u2014but he is careful only to open one that is flawless. (Notice: if the customer\u2019s box is good, then among the three remaining boxes one is defective and two are safe; if the customer\u2019s box is defective, then all three remaining boxes are good.) In other words, the clerk\u2019s choice of box to open is not completely random, but it is forced by the fact that he must reveal a good appliance.\n\nNow, if the customer is then given the option to switch his choice to one of the other unopened boxes, it might seem like a Monty Hall\u2013style dilemma. But let\u2019s compare the odds:\n\n1. If the customer \u201csticks\u201d with his original box, his chance of ending up with a flawless appliance remains the 3\u20444 probability from his initial random choice.\n\n2. Suppose instead the customer switches. After the clerk opens one box, two boxes remain unopened besides the one he originally chose. Now, if his original pick was good (which happens 75% of the time), then among the two remaining boxes one is good and one is defective. But if his original pick was the defective one (25% chance), then both of the other unopened boxes are good. If he must choose only one box when switching\u2014and if he picks one of the two remaining at random\u2014his overall chance of selecting a flawless appliance is computed as follows:\n  \u2022 With a good initial pick (75% chance): switching gives him a 1\u20442 chance to choose the good one among the two.\n  \u2022 With a defective initial pick (25% chance): switching gives him a 100% chance (since both remaining boxes are flawless).\n  Overall probability if switching = 0.75\u00d70.5 + 0.25\u00d71 = 0.375 + 0.25 = 0.625 (or 62.5%).\n\nThus, by sticking with the original box his chance is 75%, while switching (picking one of the other unopened boxes at random) gives only a 62.5% chance.\n\nTherefore, the customer is best off sticking with (keeping) his original choice."

        "We have four boxes on the shelf \u2013 one defective and three new (flawless) items. The customer picks one box at random. Then the clerk (knowing which is defective) opens one of the three boxes that the customer did not pick, making sure that the product inside is flawless. Now the customer must decide: stick with the originally picked box or switch (by choosing one of the remaining unopened boxes).\n\nHere\u2019s how to analyze the situation:\n\n1. When the customer first picks a box, the chance that the box is flawless is 3 out of 4 (75%), and the chance that it is the defective one is 1 out of 4 (25%).\n\n2. Two cases can occur:\n\n a. If the customer\u2019s initial box is flawless (75% chance), then among the remaining three boxes there is exactly one defective and two flawless items. The clerk\u2019s action of opening one of the boxes (which he chooses among those known to be flawless) leaves two unopened boxes, one flawless and one defective. If the customer switches and picks one of these at random, the chance of getting a flawless product is 1\u20442 (50%).\n\n b. If the customer\u2019s initial box is defective (25% chance), then all three remaining boxes are flawless.

If the customer stays with the original box, the probability that it is flawless remains 75%.\n\nThus, by sticking with the initial choice, the customer has a 75% chance of having a flawless appliance, which is higher than the 62.5% chance if he switches.\n\nAnswer: The customer should keep the product they already picked up.",

The clerk then opens one of the remaining three boxes and shows that it holds a good appliance. (Notice that if the customer\u2019s choice was good, then among the three left there is one defective and two good units\u2014the clerk intentionally picks a good one to reveal. If the customer\u2019s choice was defective, then all three remaining boxes are good, so whichever is opened is good.)\n\nStep 3. Now there are two unopened boxes left besides the customer\u2019s original choice. The customer has the option to switch and choose one of those two. Let\u2019s analyze the outcomes:\n\n\u2022 If the customer\u2019s original box was good (probability 3/4), then among the two other boxes one is defective and one is good. Switching would give a 1/2 chance of ending up with a good appliance.\n  So in this case, the probability of success by switching = (3/4)*(1/2) = 3/8.\n\n\u2022 If the customer\u2019s original box was defective (probability 1/4), then the two remaining unopened boxes are both good. Switching will certainly give him a good appliance.\n  So in this case, the probability of success by switching = (1/4)*1 = 1/4.\n\nAdding the two cases: the total probability if he switches is 3/8 + 1/4 = 3/8 + 2/8 = 5/8 (or 62.5%).\n\nIf he stays with his original box, his chance of having a good appliance remains 3/4 (75%).\n\nComparison:\n  Staying: 75% chance of a good appliance.\n  Switching: 62.5% chance of a good appliance.\n\nThus, the customer is more likely to end up with a good appliance by keeping the one originally chosen rather than switching. \n\nAnswer: The customer should keep the product they already picked up.",
        "We can solve the problem by comparing the chance that the appliance is good if the customer sticks with their original choice versus if they switch to one of the other unopened boxes.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the initial situation:\n\u2022 There are four boxes. One box is known to be defective (returned) and three are new.\n\u2022 The customer picks one box at random. Thus the probability that the customer\u2019s box is good is 3/4 (75%), and the chance he picked the defective one is 1/4 (25%).\n\nThen the sales clerk, knowing which one is defective, opens one of the other boxes and shows that appliance is good. (The clerk will always be able to choose a good one to open because even if the customer picked the defective box, the remaining three are all good, and if the customer picked a good one, then among the other three there are two good boxes and one defective box \u2013 the clerk avoids the defective one.)\n\nNow the remaining unopened boxes are:\n\u2013 The customer\u2019s originally chosen box.\n\u2013 Two other boxes (one or both possibly containing the defective appliance, depending on the original pick).\n\nLet\u2019s break it into cases:\n\nCase 1. Customer originally picked a good appliance (probability = 3/4).\n \u2022 In this case the defective one is among the three boxes not initially chosen.\n \u2022 The clerk\u2019s opened box is a good appliance.\n \u2022 That leaves two unopened boxes: one is defective and the other is good.\n \u2022 If the customer switches (and must choose at random among the two), he ends up with:\n  \u2013 a 50% chance of ending with a good appliance in this scenario.\n\nCase 2.

In this case, if you switch, you\u2019re guaranteed to pick a working computer from the remaining two.\n\nNow combine these probabilities:\n\u2022 For the 75% chance your initial pick is working, switching wins only half of that time: 0.75 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.375 (37.5%).\n\u2022 For the 25% chance your initial pick is defective, switching will win 100% of the time: 0.25 \u00d7 1 = 0.25 (25%).\n\u2022 Total chance of a win if you switch: 37.5% + 25% = 62.5%.\n\nIn summary:\n\u2022 Sticking with your original pick gives a 75% chance of getting a working computer.\n\u2022 Switching gives a 62.5% chance of ending up with a working computer.\n\nTherefore, it is better to keep the computer you originally picked.",
        "We start with four identical computers, one of which is defective. When you first choose a computer there is a 1 in 4 (25%) chance that you picked the defective one and a 3 in 4 (75%) chance that you picked a good one.\n\nYour friend, knowing which computers are good, turns on one of the three remaining computers and finds it flawless. Now you face the decision: should you stick with your original pick, or switch to one of the two remaining unseen computers? Let\u2019s analyze the two possibilities.\n\n1. If your original computer is good (which happens with 75% probability), then among the three initially not chosen there is one defective and two good computers. When your friend reveals one good computer, the two remaining untested computers include one good and one defective. So if you decide to switch, you\u2019ll randomly pick one of these two and have only a 50% chance of ending up with a good computer in this case.\n\n2. If your original computer is defective (25% chance), then all three of the remaining computers are good. After your friend reveals one good computer, both of the remaining untested computers are still good. So switching in this scenario gives you a 100% chance of obtaining a good computer.\n\nNow, let\u2019s calculate the total probability of ending up with a good computer if you switch:\n\n\u2022 With a 25% chance you were initially wrong, and switching gives you a good machine (25% \u00d7 1 = 25%).\n\u2022 With a 75% chance you were initially right, and switching then gives you a 50% chance (75% \u00d7 0.5 = 37.5%).\n\nThus, the overall success probability when switching is 25% + 37.5% = 62.5%.\n\nIf you decide to keep your original pick, you simply win when your initial choice is good, which happens 75% of the time.\n\nSince 75% (if you stay) is greater than 62.5% (if you switch), you should keep the computer you originally picked."
