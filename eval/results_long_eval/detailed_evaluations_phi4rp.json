        "original_response": "This scenario twists the classic trolley problem in an important way. Normally, we\u2019re asked whether to pull a lever to divert a runaway trolley away from five people\u2014sacrificing one person on an alternate track\u2014to save five lives. That\u2019s the classic utilitarian dilemma: should you cause one death to prevent five?\n\nHowever, in this version the five on the main track are already dead. That means that if you do nothing, the trolley will hit their bodies but won\u2019t actually \u201ckill\u201d anyone further. On the other hand, pulling the lever would divert the trolley onto the side track where one living person is tied up\u2014and that person would then be killed by your action.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, many would argue that actively causing the death of the one living person is indefensible when no one is actually saved by your intervention. In other words, if the five are already dead, there\u2019s no benefit in \u201csaving\u201d them by sacrificing the one; you\u2019d be choosing to harm an innocent person needlessly.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I would not pull the lever. My decision rests on the principle that one should avoid actively causing harm when there is no corresponding benefit\u2014especially when the alternative outcome (the five already being dead) means that your action would only add another needless death."

        "original_response": "This scenario is a twist on the classic \u201ctrolley problem\u201d and raises deep ethical questions. In the standard version the choice is between actively diverting a trolley to kill one person in order to save five others\u2014all of whom are alive. Here the twist is that the five \u201cpeople\u201d on the main track are described as already dead. That detail forces us to ask: if they\u2019re already dead, is there any moral imperative to \u201csave\u201d them by diverting the trolley?\n\nMany ethical frameworks would approach this differently:\n\n\u2022 A utilitarian might normally argue that sacrificing one life to save five is justified because it maximizes overall well\u2010being. However, if the five are already dead, then diverting the trolley wouldn\u2019t \u201csave\u201d any lives\u2014it would only put an innocent, living person at risk. In that light, a utilitarian calculation would suggest that there\u2019s no benefit in sacrificing the one for no net gain in lives saved.\n\n\u2022 A deontologist, who emphasizes the morality of one\u2019s actions (rather than just the outcomes), might argue that intentionally causing harm (by pulling the lever to kill the one living person) is inherently wrong\u2014even if in other versions it might be seen as \u201cthe lesser evil.\u201d\n\nBecause the five individuals are already dead, letting the trolley continue on its course would not be causing additional loss of life, while pulling the lever would actively result in the death of an innocent, living person. From this perspective, there is no moral benefit to sacrificing the one.\n\nOf course, how one answers depends greatly on one\u2019s ethical outlook and how one interprets the scenario. But given the wording\u2014that the five are already dead\u2014I would conclude that there is no justification for pulling the lever, since it would mean needlessly causing the death of a living person when no additional lives would be saved.\n\nSo, in this interpretation, I would not pull the lever."

Therefore, the probability that at least two people share a birthday is\n\n\u2003\u20031 \u2013 P(distinct) \u2248 1 \u2013 0.293 \u2248 0.707\u2003 (about 70.7%).\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nWhich answer is \u201ccorrect\u201d depends on what you meant by \u201cdo not share a birthday.\u201d \n\n\u2022 If \u201cdo not share\u201d means \u201chave different birthdays\u201d (i.e. not all are the same), then the answer is essentially 100%.\n\n\u2022 If you meant the classic birthday paradox (i.e. \u201cshare a birthday\u201d), then the answer is about 70.7%.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further clarification!"

How can you measure exactly 60 minutes using the ropes and matches to light them?",
        "original_response": "Here\u2019s one very simple solution. Although the ropes burn non\u2010uniformly (so you can\u2019t tell time by their remaining length), each rope always takes exactly 60 minutes to burn completely if lit at one end. That means if you light one rope at one end, you know that when it\u2019s fully burned away exactly 60 minutes will have passed.\n\nIn many versions of this puzzle the trick is used to measure a shorter time (for example, 15 minutes) by lighting one rope at both ends (which makes it burn in 30 minutes) and the other at one end, then lighting the other end of the second rope when the first is done. (Since the second rope had been burning for 30 minutes from one end, lighting its other end makes the rest burn in 15 minutes.) However, if your goal is simply to measure 60 minutes, you don\u2019t need any such trick\u2014you can just light one rope at one end and wait for it to burn out.\n\nThus, to measure exactly 60 minutes:\n1. Take one rope.\n2. Light it at one end using a match.\n3. Wait until the entire rope has burned away.\n\nWhen the rope is completely consumed, exactly 60 minutes will have elapsed.\n\n(Notice that the second rope isn\u2019t needed in this case; it\u2019s only useful if you wish to measure shorter intervals using the \u201cboth ends\u201d trick.)"

In that classic scenario the car is twice as likely to be behind the one \u201cunopened\u201d door as it is behind your original pick.\n\n2. In this version, however, the host opens your chosen door (Door #1) and shows a goat. (Recall that if the car were behind Door #1 the host would never reveal it.) That means Door #1 definitely isn\u2019t the car.\n\n3. With Door #1 out, only Doors #2 and #3 remain. Initially each door had a 1\u20443 chance of hiding the car. But now that we know Door #1 is a goat, the remaining probability (2\u20443) is split equally between Doors #2 and #3 \u2013 each now has a 1\u20442 chance of hiding the car.\n\n4. You then pick Door #3, and Monty offers you one last choice: stick with Door #3 or switch to Door #2. Since both doors now have a 50% chance of being the car, switching or staying gives you the same 50% chance to win.\n\nSo, in this modified version the answer is: It doesn\u2019t matter whether you stick with Door #3 or switch to Door #2\u2014you have an equal (50%) chance of winning either way."

Then, if it wasn\u2019t on Thursday, he\u2019d expect Friday, and so on through the week. Thus, he concludes that the hanging could not be a surprise. However, this reasoning is flawed because it assumes that once a day is eliminated as a possibility (due to the expectation of a later hanging), the prisoner can deduce the exact day in advance. In reality, the judge\u2019s promise that the hanging would be a surprise is self-referential and paradoxical. The prisoner\u2019s deduction neglects the fact that his expectations (based on the judge's statement) can actually prevent him from knowing the day until the moment of execution.\n\nWhen the prisoner is executed on Friday, he indeed is surprised because he truly did not know the day in advance. The apparent contradiction arises from the paradoxical nature of the judge\u2019s statement, not because the execution wasn\u2019t a surprise. \n\nSo, despite the prisoner\u2019s flawed deduction, the execution on Friday was still a surprise to him."

However, B\u2019s statement \u201cA is telling the truth\u201d is actually true (because we assumed A is a Knight).  \n\u2003\u2003This is a contradiction because a Knave cannot say something that is true.\n\nCase 2: Assume A is a Knave (K_A false).  \n\u2003\u2013 Then from A\u2019s statement (which must be false) we get: \u00acK_B is false, so K_B is true (i.e. B is a Knight).  \n\u2003\u2013 Now, since B is a Knight, his statement \u201cA is telling the truth\u201d must be true.

In this case, one of the other two holes is revealed to have a carrot, leaving the remaining hole to be the other carrot, which is safe. So if you switch, you\u2019d get a carrot.\n\nTo summarize:\n\u2022 If you stick with your original pick, you\u2019re safe (get a carrot) 2/3 of the time.\n\u2022 If you switch, you\u2019re safe only 1/3 of the time.\n\nSince your goal is to minimize the chance of being eaten (i.e. maximize your chance of getting a carrot), you should stick with your original choice.\n\nSo, the answer is: stick with your original pick."

        "original_response": "One neat \u201ctrick\u2010solution\u201d is to use the goat\u2019s own appetite to its advantage. Remember:\n\n\u2022 If the goat is left alone with the cabbage, it will happily eat it (which \u201cfeeds\u201d it), and\n\u2022 If the wolf is ever left alone with the goat, the wolf would eat the goat.\n\nSo the farmer can \u201cfeed\u201d the goat by planning his crossings so that at one point the goat is left alone with the cabbage. One way to do this is to follow a modified version of the classic river\u2010crossing plan. For example:\n\n1. First, the farmer takes the goat across the river.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Now the far bank has the goat while the near bank still has the wolf and the cabbage.\n2. The farmer returns alone to the near bank.\n3. Next, he takes the cabbage across.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 At this point the far bank has both goat and cabbage. With the farmer away, the goat \u201cfeasts\u201d on the cabbage\u2014it loves cabbage\u2014and is fed.\n4. The farmer then comes back (alone) to the near bank.\n5. Finally, he takes the wolf across.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Now the far bank holds the wolf (and, eventually, the goat will be brought over safely), and the goat is already fed.\n\nIn this sequence the key is that when the farmer brings the cabbage over (step 3) he leaves the goat alone with it. Since the goat loves cabbage it eats it and gets its fill. (Later, the farmer must still complete the crossings so that no dangerous mix\u2010ups occur\u2014but the goat\u2019s hunger is taken care of by that clever \u201cfeed\u2010up\u201d.)\n\nThus, by \u201cfeeding\u201d the goat cabbage while never leaving it unsupervised with the wolf, the farmer solves the puzzle."

        "original_response": "There\u2019s a well\u2010known puzzle about a farmer trying to cross a river with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. In it the wolf will eat the goat if they\u2019re left alone together and the goat will gorge on the cabbage if left with it unsupervised. (Incidentally, since the goat loves cabbage, \u201cfeeding the goat\u201d really means giving it the cabbage.) \n\nThe trick is that the farmer can only take one item (or go back empty\u2010handed) at a time, so he must plan his moves so that he never leaves the goat alone with either the wolf or the cabbage. One safe solution is as follows:\n\n1.\u2003Take the goat across the river. \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Left bank: wolf, cabbage \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Right bank: goat\n\n2.\u2003Return alone to the original bank.\n\n3.\u2003Take the cabbage across.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Left bank: wolf \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Right bank: goat, cabbage\n\n\u2003\u2003(If the farmer were to leave the goat with the cabbage unsupervised, the goat would eat it. That\u2019s why he must be careful.)\n\n4.\u2003Bring the goat back to the original bank.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Left bank: goat, wolf \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Right bank: cabbage\n\n5.\u2003Take the wolf across.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Left bank: goat \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Right bank: wolf, cabbage\n\n6.\u2003Return alone to the original bank.\n\n7.\u2003Finally, take the goat across.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Left bank: (empty)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Right bank: wolf, goat, cabbage\n\nNow that all three are safely on the far bank\u2014and the farmer is there to supervise\u2014the goat can be \u201cfed\u201d its beloved cabbage. (Of course, if left unsupervised the goat would gobble it up, but with the farmer present everything is under control.)\n\nSo, in short, the farmer feeds the goat by ultimately giving it the cabbage\u2014but only after carefully transporting everyone so that no dangerous combinations are left alone."

        "original_response": "Here\u2019s one way to \u201csolve\u201d the riddle:\n\nImagine the classic setup: a farmer must transport three \u201ccargo\u201d items\u2014a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage\u2014across a river without ever leaving a dangerous mix unattended. In the traditional puzzle the goat can\u2019t be left with the cabbage (lest it be eaten) and the wolf can\u2019t be left with the goat. Now, with a twist, the cabbage isn\u2019t just any cabbage at all\u2014it\u2019s an undercover detective working on a case of vegetable theft. Meanwhile, the wolf and goat aren\u2019t enemies but best friends running a food business (and, as it happens, they\u2019re the prime suspects in the theft).\n\nSo how can the farmer help the detective gather evidence? One clever solution is for the farmer to use his boat not just for safe transport but as a cover for the detective\u2019s covert investigation. For example, the farmer could do the following:\n\n1. First, take the wolf (or the goat) across the river. In the classic puzzle the order matters, but here the twist is that the undercover cabbage is best not to be seen with the suspects. By keeping the detective (cabbage) on the original bank while ferrying the wolf and goat, the detective can secretly observe their behavior.\n\n2. When the wolf and goat are together on the far bank, they\u2019ll be busy setting up (or gossiping about) their food business\u2014and, inevitably, they\u2019ll let slip incriminating details about their vegetable theft operation. (After all, best friends in cahoots are often overconfident.)\n\n3. Then the farmer returns to pick up the undercover cabbage, who by then has gathered plenty of \u201cevidence\u201d (overheard conversations, suspicious receipts, or even a trail of vegetable \u201cleads\u201d) against his criminal partners.\n\n4. Finally, the farmer brings the detective (cabbage) back across\u2014now fully in possession of the proof needed to bust the wolf\u2013goat food business.\n\nIn short, by carefully choosing which suspects to ferry first and leaving the undercover detective behind to \u201ceavesdrop\u201d on the operation, the farmer turns a classic river-crossing puzzle into an undercover sting. The detective (cabbage) is never left unsupervised with the suspects, and in the process, he collects all the evidence needed to expose the vegetable theft ring.\n\nThat\u2019s one way the farmer can \u201chelp\u201d the detective gather evidence without blowing his cover!"

In other words, he first ferries the wolf and goat across the river\u2014leaving the cabbage behind. With the wolf and goat busy running their operation on the far bank, the undercover detective is free to discreetly observe and record any evidence of vegetable theft. Once enough proof has been gathered, the farmer can then return to pick up the cabbage, ensuring that his cover isn\u2019t blown.\n\nIn short, by carefully timing the crossings so that the detective is left unsupervised on the \u201cscene\u201d while the wolf and goat are away, the farmer helps him collect the evidence needed to expose their illegal vegetable trade."

You initially pick one door (say, Door 1). Then the host, who knows what\u2019s behind each door, opens one of the other two doors (Door 2) to reveal a goat. Now only Door 1 (your original pick) and Door 3 remain closed.\n\nHere\u2019s the key point: when you made your first pick, there was a 1/3 chance you chose the car and a 2/3 chance the car was behind one of the other doors. The host\u2019s action of opening a goat door doesn\u2019t change those odds; it just shows you that one of the \u201cother\u201d doors is definitely not the car. That 2/3 chance is now entirely on the one remaining unopened door (Door 3).\n\nSo, if you stick with Door 1, your chance of winning is 1/3. But if you switch to Door 3, your chance goes up to 2/3.

        "original_response": "We can solve the problem by \u201ctracking\u201d the reproduction of rabbit\u2010pairs. (Note that although the problem says \u201cone rabbit,\u201d the reproduction rule applies to a pair. In other words, you really need a mating pair to start breeding. So the intended starting condition is one pair\u2014that is, two rabbits.)\n\nAssume that a pair of rabbits does not reproduce until it is two years old, and that once they reach that age they produce two baby rabbits (which make a new pair) once per year.\n\nLet P(n) be the number of pairs at the end of year n. We start with\n\n\u2003\u2003P(0) = 1\u2003\u2003(the original pair)\n\nSince the rabbits aren\u2019t mature in their first year, no reproduction occurs in year\u00a01:\n\u2003\u2003P(1) = 1\n\nNow, at the end of year\u00a02 the original pair (now 2 years old) reproduces. They produce 2 baby rabbits\u2014that is, 1 new pair. So\n\n\u2003\u2003P(2) = P(1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nFor later years the rule is that every pair that is at least 2 years old produces one new pair each year. (Notice that a pair born in year n reproduces at the end of year n+2.) Thus the number of new pairs produced in year n is exactly the number of pairs that were already present two years earlier; that is, the recurrence\n\n\u2003\u2003P(n) = P(n \u2013 1) + P(n \u2013 2)\u2003\u2003for n \u2265 2\n\nThis is the Fibonacci recurrence. Let\u2019s list the numbers:\n\n\u2003\u2003Year 0: P(0) = 1\n\u2003\u2003Year 1: P(1) = 1\n\u2003\u2003Year 2: P(2) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\u2003\u2003Year 3: P(3) = P(2) + P(1) = 2 + 1 = 3\n\u2003\u2003Year 4: P(4) = P(3) + P(2) = 3 + 2 = 5\n\u2003\u2003Year 5: P(5) = P(4) + P(3) = 5 + 3 = 8\n\u2003\u2003Year 6: P(6) = P(5) + P(4) = 8 + 5 = 13\n\u2003\u2003Year 7: P(7) = P(6) + P(5) = 13 + 8 = 21\n\nAt the end of 7 years there are 21 pairs. Since each pair consists of 2 rabbits, the total number of rabbits is\n\n\u2003\u200321 pairs \u00d7 2 rabbits per pair = 42 rabbits.\n\nThus, if you start with one pair (i.e. two rabbits) the stable will contain 42 rabbits after 7 years."

(Note: Although the problem says \u201cone rabbit,\u201d the wording \u201ca pair of rabbits gives birth\u2026\u201d is meant to describe the breeding unit. In these puzzles the assumption is that you start with one breeding pair\u2014that is, two rabbits\u2014which is why the reproduction \u201crule\u201d makes sense. Under that common interpretation, here\u2019s how the math works.)\n\nAssume that a breeding pair (two rabbits) does not reproduce until it is 2 years old and that once it is 2 or more years old it produces 2 baby rabbits (i.e. one new pair) each year. (In other words, every mature pair \u201cproduces\u201d one new pair per year.) If you start with one pair at time 0, then the number of pairs evolves just like the Fibonacci numbers. (This is analogous to the famous \u201crabbit reproduction\u201d puzzle\u2014but with a one\u2010year generation time and a two\u2013year delay before reproduction begins.)\n\nLet P(n) be the number of pairs at the end of year n.

With a movable object, there\u2019s no contradiction: the unstoppable force does what it does\u2014it moves the object.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\u2022 If you take the definitions literally, an unstoppable force will always act, and a movable object is, by definition, one that can be moved.\n\u2022 Therefore, when they meet, the unstoppable force simply moves the movable object.\n\u2022 This thought experiment shows the limits of extreme definitions rather than describing any physically real event.\n\nThus, the answer is: The unstoppable force moves the movable object."

        "original_response": "There are four boxes with one defective and three good. When you first pick a box your chance of having a good one is 3\u20444 (and only 1\u20444 that you\u2019ve picked the defective). After your pick the host, who always shows a flawless (good) box when possible, opens one of the other three. (If you had picked the defective, then all three remaining are good; if you had picked a good one, then among the other three there are two good and one defective\u2014but the host must show a good one.) \n\nNow you\u2019re left with three unopened boxes: the one you originally chose and the two that the host did not open. Notice that if you switch your choice (i.e. pick one of the other two), your overall chance of ending up with a good box works out as follows:\n\n\u2022 If your original box was defective (a 1\u20444 chance), then both of the other two are good\u2014so switching would guarantee a good box.  \n\u2022 However, if your original box was good (a 3\u20444 chance), then the defective must be hiding among the two unopened boxes, so if you switch you have only a 50% chance of avoiding it.\n\nThus, the overall win probability if you switch is:\n\u2003\u2003(1\u20444 \u00d7 1) + (3\u20444 \u00d7 \u00bd) = 1\u20444 + 3\u20448 = 5\u20448, or 62.5%.\n\nOn the other hand, if you stick with your original box your chance of success is simply the probability it was good from the start\u20143\u20444, or 75%.\n\nSo even though the host\u2019s reveal gives some information, it does not improve your odds by switching. In fact, switching would lower your chance of ending up with a good appliance.\n\nAnswer: The contestant\u2019s best bet is to stick with the box they originally picked."

        "original_response": "We start with four boxes on the shelf \u2013 one is defective and three are good. The customer picks one box at random, so initially the chance his box is good is 3\u20444 (and defective 1\u20444).\n\nThen the clerk, who knows which box is defective, opens one of the other three boxes and shows that it is in perfect condition. (Notice that if the customer\u2019s box were defective, all three of the others would be good; if his box were good, then among the three not chosen there is exactly one defective and two good ones\u2014and the clerk can always open a good one.)\n\nNow the customer faces a choice:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Keep his originally picked box.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003\u201cSwitch\u201d by giving up his box and taking one of the two remaining unopened boxes (the clerk has already shown one to be good, so only two boxes are left aside from his own).\n\nLet\u2019s see what happens in each case.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nCase 1. The customer keeps his original box.\n\nHis box is good with probability 3\u20444 and defective with probability 1\u20444. So by sticking, his chance of getting a good product is 75%.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nCase 2.

If his original box was defective (which happens with probability 1\u20444):\n\u2003\u2013 Then all the other three boxes are good. The clerk\u2019s reveal is automatic, and the two boxes available for switching are both good. So if he switches in this case he certainly gets a good product.\n\nB. If his original box was good (which happens with probability 3\u20444):\n\u2003\u2013 Then the defective box is among the other three boxes. Since the clerk must avoid opening the defective one, he will open one of the two good boxes among those three. That leaves the two unopened boxes (apart from his own) consisting of one defective and one good box.\n\u2003\u2013 If the customer now picks one at random from these two, he has a 50% chance of choosing the good one and a 50% chance of ending up with the defective one.\n\nNow, let\u2019s combine these:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003In subcase A: (Probability 1\u20444) \u00d7 (100% chance good if switching) = 1\u20444.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003In subcase B: (Probability 3\u20444) \u00d7 (50% chance good if switching) = (3\u20444)\u00d7(1\u20442) = 3\u20448.\n\nAdding these together gives an overall switching success rate of\n\u2003\u20031\u20444 + 3\u20448 = 2\u20448 + 3\u20448 = 5\u20448 = 62.5%.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nComparison\n\n\u2022\u2003Sticking with his original box gives a 75% chance of a good product.\n\u2022\u2003Switching gives only a 62.5% chance.\n\nThus, the customer is better off keeping the box he originally picked.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nAnswer\n\nThe customer should keep the product he already picked up."

If your chosen computer is good (2\u20443 chance):\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The two remaining computers consist of one good and one defective.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Your friend, wanting to show you a working computer, will test the good one.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 That leaves the untested computer as the defective one.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 So if you switch in this case, you\u2019d end up with the defective computer.\n\n2. If your chosen computer is defective (1\u20443 chance):\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The remaining two are both good.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Your friend can test either one (or choose at random) and the one left untested will also be good.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 So if you switch in this case, you\u2019d get a good computer.\n\nThus, if you switch:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 You end up with a good computer only if your original pick was defective, which happens with probability 1\u20443.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 You end up with a defective computer if your original pick was good (2\u20443 chance).\n\nOn the other hand, if you keep your original computer, you have a 2\u20443 chance it\u2019s good.\n\nSo, even though it might look like a \u201cMonty Hall\u2013style\u201d twist, the key difference is that your friend is deliberately showing you a working computer when possible. That means:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 If your computer is good (most likely), switching would force you into the defective one.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Only if your computer is defective (a 1\u20443 chance) would switching be beneficial.\n\nTherefore, you should keep the computer you originally picked."

        "original_response": "Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nImagine there are three computers: one is defective and two are flawless. You pick one at random. That means initially you have a 2/3 chance your pick is good and a 1/3 chance it\u2019s defective.\n\nNow your friend \u201cswitches one on\u201d among the two you didn\u2019t choose and finds it is flawless. Because your friend knows which one is defective, he can choose which computer to test. In order to help you get a good computer, he will pick a computer he knows is good if possible.\n\nThere are two cases:\n\n1. If your initial pick was good (which happens with probability 2/3), then the two computers left consist of one good and one defective. Your friend, wanting to help, will test the good one. That leaves the untested computer as the defective one. So if you switch, you\u2019d end up with the defective computer.\n\n2. If your initial pick was defective (probability 1/3), then both of the remaining computers are good. No matter which one your friend tests (or even if he chooses at random), the other untested computer is good. So if you switch in this case, you\u2019d get a good computer.\n\nThus, if you switch:\n\u2003\u2022 With probability 2/3 (if your first pick was good) you end up with the defective one.\n\u2003\u2022 With probability 1/3 (if your first pick was defective) you end up with a good one.\n\nThat gives you only a 1/3 chance of ending up with a good computer if you switch.\n\nOn the other hand, if you keep your original pick, you already have a 2/3 chance that it is good.\n\nSo, even though your friend\u2019s action of testing one computer gives you some information, it actually tells you that if he could avoid revealing a defective one (and he can, because he knows which is which), then it\u2019s very likely that your initial pick was good.\n\nTherefore, you should keep the computer you picked."

        "original_response": "Let\u2019s analyze the situation step\u2010by\u2010step.\n\nYou have four computers, one of which is defective. When you pick one at random, the chance it\u2019s good is 3\u20444 (75%) and the chance it\u2019s defective is 1\u20444 (25%).\n\nNow your friend, who knows which one is defective, looks at the three you didn\u2019t pick and turns one on. Since he wants to help you get a good computer, he will choose one that he knows is flawless. (This is similar to how the host in the Monty Hall problem always avoids revealing the prize.)\n\nThere are two cases:\n\n1. If your original pick was good (which happens with probability 75%), then among the three remaining there is 1 defective and 2 good. Knowing this, your friend can deliberately pick one of the two good ones to test. That leaves the two untested computers as one good and one defective. So if you switch (i.e. choose at random between these two), you\u2019d have a 50% chance of ending up with the good one.\n\n2. If your original pick was defective (25% chance), then all three of the computers your friend could choose from are good. In that case, after he tests one (which will obviously work), the two untested ones are both good. So if you switch, you are guaranteed to get a good computer.\n\nNow let\u2019s compute the overall chance of getting a good computer if you switch:\n\n\u2022 When your pick is good (75% chance): switching gives you a 50% chance \u2192 0.75 \u00d7 0.50 = 0.375 (37.5% overall)\n\u2022 When your pick is defective (25% chance): switching gives you 100% chance \u2192 0.25 \u00d7 1 = 0.25 (25% overall)\n\nAdding these up: 37.5% + 25% = 62.5%\n\nOn the other hand, if you stick with your original pick, you get a good computer with the initial probability of 75%.\n\nThus, switching (to one of the two untested ones) gives you only about a 62.5% chance of a good computer, which is worse than the 75% chance you already have with your first pick.\n\nAnswer: You should keep the computer you originally picked."

Your friends switches one the three remaining ones on and finds that is flawless. Should you keep the computer you picked or switch to another one?",
        "original_response": "Here\u2019s the reasoning.\n\nImagine the four computers are labeled A, B, C, and D, with exactly one being defective and the other three working fine. You pick one at random. That means:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003There\u2019s a 3\u20444 chance your pick is good.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003There\u2019s a 1\u20444 chance it\u2019s defective.\n\nThen your friend, who knows which one is bad, takes one of the three remaining computers, turns it on, and finds it works. (He can always choose a working one.) Now two computers remain unopened (aside from your original pick). At this point you\u2019re offered a choice: stick with your original computer or \u201cswitch\u201d (i.e. take one of the two unopened ones at random).\n\nLet\u2019s look at the two cases:\n\n1. If your original pick was good (which happens 3\u20444 of the time):\n\u2003\u2013 Among the three computers your friend didn\u2019t pick, exactly one is defective and two work.\n\u2003\u2013 Knowing this, your friend will reveal one of the two good ones.\n\u2003\u2013 That leaves the two unopened computers: one is good and one is defective.\n\u2003\u2013 If you switch by picking at random among these two, you have a 50% chance of ending up with the good one.\n\n2. If your original pick was defective (which happens 1\u20444 of the time):\n\u2003\u2013 Then all three of the remaining computers work.\n\u2003\u2013 Your friend can reveal any one (it will work), and the other two unopened ones are both good.\n\u2003\u2013 If you switch (choosing at random among these two), you\u2019re guaranteed to get a good computer.\n\nNow, if you switch you face these overall odds:\n\u2003\u2013 With probability 3\u20444 (if you originally picked good) you only have a 50% chance of a good computer.\n\u2003\u2013 With probability 1\u20444 (if you originally picked defective) you get a good computer for sure.\nSo the overall chance of ending up with a good computer if you switch is:\n\u2003(3\u20444 \u00d7 50%) + (1\u20444 \u00d7 100%) = (0.75 \u00d7 0.5) + (0.25 \u00d7 1) = 0.375 + 0.25 = 0.625 or 62.5%.\n\nOn the other hand, if you simply keep your original pick, you already have a 75% chance (3\u20444) that it\u2019s good.\n\nBecause 75% > 62.5%, you are better off keeping the computer you originally picked.\n\nNote:\nSome might wonder if you could \u201cswitch\u201d to the one your friend just turned on (since you see it works). In that case you\u2019d always get a good computer. However, the usual interpretation in this puzzle is that your friend only demonstrates that one of the other computers works and then lets you choose at random among the remaining unopened ones. Under that scenario, sticking with your first pick gives you the higher overall chance of a good computer.\n\nSo the answer is: You should keep the computer you picked."
