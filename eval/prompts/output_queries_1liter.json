        "A classic puzzle!\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Fill the 1-liter jug completely.\n2. Pour the water from the 1-liter jug into the other 1-liter jug. This jug is now full, and the first jug is empty.\n3. Fill the first 1-liter jug again.\n4. Pour the water from the first jug into the second jug, until the second jug is full. Since the second jug was already full from step 2, it will spill over, and the first jug will have 500 milliliters left.\n5. Empty the second jug (which now contains 1 liter).\n6. Pour the 500 milliliters from the first jug into the second jug.\n7. Fill the first jug again.\n8. Pour the water from the first jug into the second jug, until the second jug is full (which is now at 1 liter).\n9. The second jug now contains exactly 1 liter.\n\nThe solution works because each step ensures that the volume of water transferred is a multiple of 1 liter. This way, the water in the second jug gradually accumulates to exactly 1 liter over the course of the steps.",
        "To measure exactly 1 liter using a 1-liter jug and another 1-liter jug, you need to follow a simple procedure.\n\n1. **Fill the first jug completely with water**, which would be the easy part, in this case, 1 liter.\n2. **Pour the water from the first jug into the second jug** until the second jug is full. This leaves the first jug empty and the second jug now contains 1 liter of water.\n\nHowever, to actually measure 1 liter using both jugs, you'll use the empty second jug to \"measure\" against the full first jug. Here's how:\n\n3. **Empty the water from the second jug** and **pour water from the full first jug into the second jug until the second jug is full again**. Now, refill the first jug completely but not the second jug, which now has 1 liter of water in it. This ensures you have the second jug filled to the exact 1-liter mark.\n\n**The second jug now contains exactly 1 liter of water,** which is the desired measurement.",
        "Here are the steps to measure exactly 1 liter using a 1-liter jug and another 1-liter jug:\n\n1. Fill one jug completely to the 1-liter mark.\n2. Pour water from the full jug into the other empty jug until the first jug is empty.\n3. Now, the first jug is empty and the second jug has some amount of water, let's say x liters.\n4. To measure 1 liter, you need to empty the second jug and add 1 - x liters to it. But since you only have one empty jug, you can't do that directly.\n5. However, you can use the following trick:\n   a. Pour water from the second jug back into the first jug, which is empty, until the first jug is full again (i.e., 1 liter).\n   b. The second jug will now be empty.\n\nYou have measured 1 liter of water. You can repeat the process multiple times to get the required amount of water."
