If radioactive decay is detected, the hammer breaks the poison vial, killing the cat.\n\nIf we start with a dead cat as stated in your question, the probability of the cat being alive after one day would be 0% - as a dead cat cannot become alive again regardless of whether the poison is released or not.\n\nIf you meant to ask about Schr\u00f6dinger's original thought experiment (starting with a live cat), then according to quantum mechanics, before the box is opened, the cat exists in a superposition of states (both alive and dead). The probability of finding the cat alive when opening the box would depend on the half-life of the radioactive isotope used in the experiment.\n\nWould you like me to explain more about Schr\u00f6dinger's original thought experiment?"

Light the first rope at BOTH ends\n2. At the same time, light the second rope at ONE end only\n\nWhat happens:\n- The first rope, lit at both ends, will burn twice as fast and take exactly 30 minutes to burn completely (since it's burning from both ends and meets in the middle)\n- When the first rope is completely burned (after 30 minutes), immediately light the other end of the second rope\n- The second rope has already been burning for 30 minutes from one end, so it has 30 minutes remaining\n- When you light the other end of the second rope, the remaining 30 minutes will be burned in 15 minutes (since it's now burning from both ends)\n\nTotal time: 30 minutes + 15 minutes = 45 minutes\n\nThis solution works because even though the ropes burn unevenly, lighting a rope from both ends will still make it burn in exactly half the time, regardless of the uneven burning rate.\n\nWait... I just realized the question asked for measuring 60 minutes, not 45! For measuring exactly 60 minutes, you only need to light one rope at one end and wait for it to burn completely.
