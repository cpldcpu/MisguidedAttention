        "1. Fill the 12-liter jug completely.\n2. Pour water from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug until the 6-liter jug is full.  This leaves 6 liters in the 12-liter jug.\n3. Empty the 6-liter jug.\n4. Pour the 6 liters from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug.\n5. Fill the 12-liter jug completely again.\n6. Carefully pour water from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug (which already has 6 liters) until the 6-liter jug is full. This will use 0 liters from the 12 and leave exactly 10 in the larger jug, emptying the smaller one.\n7. Empty the smaller jug.\n8. Pour contents from larger jug (10 liters) into smaller jug. This leaves 10 liters in the smaller jug with 0 left in the larger one.\n9. Fill larger jug (12 liter) completely. \n10.Pour water from larger jug into smaller jug (currently filled with 6 liters). This takes 2 liters out of the larger jug to fill the smaller jug, leaving exactly 4 liters in the larger jug.\n",
