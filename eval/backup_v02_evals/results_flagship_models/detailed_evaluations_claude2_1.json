Light the other end of the second rope with a new match when the first match that lit the second rope goes out.\n\n4. When the second rope burns out completely, 60 minutes (30 + 30) will have passed since the first rope was lit at both ends.\n\nThe key ideas are:\n\n- Each rope takes 60 minutes to burn completely \n- Lighting both ends makes the rope burn in half the time (30 minutes)\n- Using the first burning match as a 30 minute timer for when to light the second end of the second rope\n\nSo when the second rope fully burns, 60 minutes have elapsed."
