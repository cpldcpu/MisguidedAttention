According to traditional interpretation, until the box is opened, the cat is simultaneously alive and dead due to the principle of quantum superposition. At the moment the box is opened, the cat's state will \"collapse\" into either alive or dead. Therefore, before the box is opened, it's impossible to assign a definite probability to the cat being alive. However, if we follow the interpretation that the act of opening is what determines the cat's state, we can potentially say the probability is 50% - it is either dead or alive. This, of course, is a simplification and an interpretation that does not account for all the complexities of quantum mechanics."
