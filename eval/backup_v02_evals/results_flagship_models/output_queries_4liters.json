The `selectionSort` function takes an array `arr` and its size `size` as parameters.\n2. The outer loop iterates from index 0 to `size - 2` (since the last element will be automatically sorted).\n3. In each iteration of the outer loop:\n   - We assume the current element at index `i` is the minimum and store its index in `min_idx`.\n   - The inner loop starts from the next element (`i + 1`) and compares each element with the current minimum element.\n   - If an element smaller than the current minimum is found, we update `min_idx` to store the index of the new minimum element.\n   - After the inner loop, we swap the minimum element (at index `min_idx`) with the current element (at index `i`).\n4. The `printArray` function is used to print the elements of the array.\n5. In the `main` function:\n   - We define an array `arr` and calculate its size `n`.\n   - We print the original array using `printArray`.\n   - We call the `selectionSort` function to sort the array.\n   - Finally, we print the sorted array using `printArray`.\n\nOutput:\n```\nOriginal array:\n64 25 12 22 11\nSorted array:\n11 12 22 25 64\n```\n\nThe time complexity of selection sort is O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, where n is the number of elements in the array. The space complexity is O(1) since it sorts the array in-place without using any additional data structures."

        "To measure exact volumes using two unmarked jugs, we rely on the mathematical principle of the greatest common divisor (GCD). The basic idea is that the volumes we can measure are integer combinations of the jug sizes, specifically multiples of the GCD of their capacities.\n\n**Given Jugs:**\n- Jug A: 6 liters\n- Jug B: 12 liters\n\n**Goal:**\n- Measure exactly 4 liters.\n\n**Understanding the Limitation:**\n\n1. **Calculate the GCD of Jug Sizes:**\n   - GCD of 6 and 12 is **6**.\n   \n2. **Determine Possible Measurable Volumes:**\n   - Using the two jugs, you can measure volumes that are multiples of the GCD.\n   - Possible volumes: 0L, 6L, 12L, 18L (though limited by jug capacities), etc.\n\n3. **Check if the Desired Volume is Achievable:**\n   - Since 4 liters is not a multiple of the GCD (6), it cannot be measured using these jugs.\n   - Volumes like 4 liters are **impossible** to obtain with only 6-liter and 12-liter jugs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIt is **impossible** to measure exactly 4 liters using only a 6-liter jug and a 12-liter jug.

        "To measure exactly 4 liters using only a 6-liter jug and a 12-liter jug, we need to find a sequence of steps that allows us to isolate exactly 4 liters in one of the jugs. However, in this specific case, it is **not possible** to measure exactly 4 liters using only these two jugs without any additional markings or measuring tools. Here's why:\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Possible Measurable Volumes:**\n\n   - **6-liter Jug:** Can measure volumes in increments of 6 liters (i.e., 0 or 6 liters).\n   - **12-liter Jug:** Can measure volumes in increments of 12 liters (i.e., 0 or 12 liters).\n\n2. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**\n\n   - The GCD of 6 and 12 is **6**.\n   - Using these jugs, you can only measure volumes that are multiples of 6 liters (e.g., 0, 6, 12 liters).\n\n3. **Target Volume:**\n\n   - **4 liters** is not a multiple of 6.\n   - Therefore, it's impossible to measure exactly 4 liters using only these two jugs.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWithout additional tools or markings on the jugs, you cannot measure exactly 4 liters using a 6-liter jug and a 12-liter jug. To measure 4 liters, you would need jugs whose capacities have a GCD that divides evenly into 4 (e.g., capacities of 3 liters and 5 liters, which have a GCD of 1).\n\n**Alternative Solution with Different Jug Sizes:**\n\nIf you had a 3-liter jug and a 5-liter jug, you could measure exactly 4 liters by following these steps:\n\n1. **Fill the 3-liter jug** completely and pour its contents into the 5-liter jug.\n2. **Fill the 3-liter jug** again and pour into the 5-liter jug until the 5-liter jug is full.\n   - This leaves you with **1 liter** in the 3-liter jug because the 5-liter jug can only hold 2 more liters.\n3. **Empty the 5-liter jug** and transfer the **1 liter** from the 3-liter jug to the 5-liter jug.\n4. **Fill the 3-liter jug** again and pour it into the 5-liter jug.\n   - Now, the 5-liter jug contains **4 liters**.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The impossibility arises due to the mathematical relationship between the jug sizes and the desired measurement. With the 6-liter and 12-liter jugs, the lack of common divisibility with 4 liters makes the task unachievable under the given constraints.",
        "To measure exactly **4 liters** using a **6-liter jug** and a **12-liter jug**, we need to find a sequence of filling and transferring steps that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 4 liters. However, due to the capacities of the jugs and the mathematical principles underlying such puzzles, it's **impossible** to measure exactly 4 liters with these two jugs alone.\n\n### **Explanation:**\n\n- **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):** The key to solving jug problems is understanding that you can measure amounts that are multiples of the **greatest common divisor** (GCD) of the jug capacities.\n  \n- **Calculating GCD:** The capacities are 6 liters and 12 liters. The GCD of 6 and 12 is **6**.\n\n- **Possible Measurable Amounts:** This means you can only measure amounts that are multiples of 6 liters: **0 liters, 6 liters, and 12 liters**.\n\n- **Limitation:** Since **4 liters** is not a multiple of 6, it's impossible to measure exactly 4 liters using only these two jugs without any additional tools or markings.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nWith a **6-liter jug** and a **12-liter jug**, and using standard jug problem rules (jugs have no measurement markings, and you can only fill, transfer, or empty the full capacity of a jug), you cannot measure exactly **4 liters**. You would need jugs with capacities whose GCD divides evenly into 4, or you would need a jug with measurement markings to achieve this."

Empty the 6-liter jug into the 12-liter jug until the 12-liter jug is full, which means you pour 6 liters into the 12-liter jug, but it can only take 0 liters (actually, it's full, so you can't pour anything into it).\n   That's incorrect.\n   The correct process is:\n   Fill the 6-liter jug from the 12-liter jug.\n   Empty the 6-liter jug.\n   Fill the 6-liter jug from the 12-liter jug again.\n   Now, you have 0 liters left in the 12-liter jug.\n   Fill the 12-liter jug again.\n   Pour from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug until the 6-liter jug is full, which requires 0 liters since it's already full.\n   Empty the 6-liter jug and fill it from the 12-liter jug.\n   Now, the 12-liter jug has 6 liters.\n   Fill the 6-liter jug from the remaining 6 liters in the 12-liter jug.\n   Now, you have 0 liters left in the 12-liter jug and 6 liters in the 6-liter jug.\n   Fill the 12-liter jug again.\n   Pour water from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug until the 6-liter jug is full, which requires 0 liters since it's already full.\n   You need to have 4 liters left in the 12-liter jug.\n   Let's correct the process:\n   Fill the 12-liter jug.\n   Pour water from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug until the 6-liter jug is full, leaving 6 liters remaining in the 12-liter jug.\n   Empty the 6-liter jug.\n   Pour the remaining 6 liters from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug.\n   Fill the 12-liter jug again.\n   Pour water from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug until the 6-liter jug is full, which requires 0 liters.\n   You need to have 4 liters left in the 12-liter jug.\n   Fill the 6-liter jug from the 12-liter jug, leaving 6 liters in the 12-liter jug.\n   Empty the 6-liter jug.\n   Pour the remaining 6 liters from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug.\n   Now, fill the 12-liter jug again.\n   Pour from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug until the 6-liter jug is full, which requires 0 liters.\n   We want to have 4 liters left in the 12-liter jug.\n   Fill the 12-liter jug completely.\n   Pour from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug until the 6-liter jug is full, leaving 6 liters remaining in the 12-liter jug.\n   Empty the 6-liter jug.\n   Pour the remaining 6 liters from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug.\n   Fill the 12-liter jug again.\n   Now, pour water from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug until the 6-liter jug is full, which requires 0 liters.\n   You need 4 liters left in the 12-liter jug.\n   To get that, fill the 6-liter jug from the 12-liter jug, leaving 6 liters in the 12-liter jug.\n   Empty the 6-liter jug.\n   Pour the remaining 6 liters from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug.\n   Fill the 12-liter jug again.\n   Pour water from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug until the 6-liter jug is full, which requires 0 liters.\n   We want to have 4 liters left in the 12-liter jug.\n   Fill the 12-liter jug completely.\n   Fill the 6-liter jug from the 12-liter jug.\n   Empty the 6-liter jug.\n   Fill the 6-liter jug from the remaining 6 liters in the 12-liter jug.\n   Now, the 12-liter jug is empty, and the 6-liter jug has 6 liters.\n   Fill the 12-liter jug.\n   Pour from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug until the 6-liter jug is full, which requires 0 liters.\n   Now, you need to have 4 liters left in the 12-liter jug.\n   Fill the 12-liter jug completely.\n   Pour from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug until the 6-liter jug is full, leaving 6 liters remaining in the 12-liter jug.\n   Empty the 6-liter jug.\n   Pour the remaining 6 liters from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug.\n   Fill the 6-liter jug from the 12-liter jug after filling the 12"
