Pour from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug until the 6-liter jug reaches 4 liters. This will take exactly 4 liters, leaving 8 liters in the 12-liter jug.\n\nSo by carefully pouring back and forth between the 12-liter jug and 6-liter jug, you can accurately measure out 4 liters.",
        "Here are the steps to measure exactly 4 liters using a 6-liter jug and a 12-liter jug:\n\n1. Fill the 12-liter jug all the way.\n2. Pour from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug until the 6-liter jug is full. There are now 6 liters in the 6-liter jug and 6 liters remaining in the 12-liter jug.\n3. Empty the 6-liter jug so it's empty.\n4. Pour the remaining 6 liters from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug, filling it. \n5. Fill the 12-liter jug again all the way so there are 12 liters.\n6. Pour from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug, which already has 6 liters, until the 6-liter jug is full. This adds 4 liters to the 6 liters already there.\n7. The 6-liter jug now contains exactly 4 liters!",
        "Here is the step-by-step solution to measure 4 liters using a 6-liter and 12-liter jug:\n\n1. Fill the 12-liter jug completely.\n2. Pour water from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug until it is full. There are now 6 liters in the 6-liter jug and 6 liters remaining in the 12-liter jug.\n3. Empty the 6-liter jug so it is empty again.\n4. Pour the remaining 6 liters from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug, filling it. \n5. Fill the 12-liter jug again completely so there are 12 liters in it.\n6. Pour from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug until the 6-liter jug is full. This leaves 4 liters in the 12-liter jug.\n\nTherefore, to measure exactly 4 liters using a 6-liter and 12-liter jug, follow the above steps. The key is to utilize the 6-liter jug as an intermediate jug to transfer water from the large 12-liter jug until exactly 4 liters remain."

Therefore, the time between when the first rope finished burning and you relit the second rope from the other end is 20 minutes (100 - 80).\n\nSo by lighting both ropes at the same time, then relighting the remaining part of the second rope when the first rope finishes, you can measure out a 20 minute time span.",
