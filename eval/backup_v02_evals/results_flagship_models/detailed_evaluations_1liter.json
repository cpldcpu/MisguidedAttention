This jug is now full, and the first jug is empty.\n3. Fill the first 1-liter jug again.\n4. Pour the water from the first jug into the second jug, until the second jug is full.

Pour the 500 milliliters from the first jug into the second jug.\n7. Fill the first jug again.\n8. Pour the water from the first jug into the second jug, until the second jug is full (which is now at 1 liter).\n9.
