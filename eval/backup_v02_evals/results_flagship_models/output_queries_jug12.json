        "What a classic puzzle!\n\nTo solve this problem, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Pour the 2-liter jug into the 1-liter jug, leaving 1 liter of space empty in the 2-liter jug.\n2. Fill up the 2-liter jug again, and discard the 2 liters that are already in there. This leaves 1 liter in the 1-liter jug, but we don't need that 1 liter.\n3. Now, pour the 1 liter back into the 2-liter jug. This leaves 1 liter in the 1-liter jug.\n4. Fill up the 1-liter jug again, and pour it into the 2-liter jug. This adds 1 liter to the 2 liters already in the 2-liter jug, making 3 liters!\n5. Now, empty the 2-liter jug, and you have exactly 3 liters!\n\nHowever, this solution might be a bit confusing, so let's visualize the steps:\n\nInitial state:\n\n* 1-liter jug: Empty\n* 2-liter jug: Empty\n\nStep 1: Pour 2 liters into 1-liter jug, leaving 1 liter empty.\n\n* 1-liter jug: 2 liters\n* 2-liter jug: 1 liter\n\nStep 2: Fill 2-liter jug, discard 2 liters, and pour back into 1-liter jug.\n\n* 1-liter jug: 1 liter\n* 2-liter jug: Empty\n\nStep 3: Fill 1-liter jug, pour into 2-liter jug.\n\n* 1-liter jug: Empty\n* 2-liter jug: 1 liter\n\nStep 4: Fill 1-liter jug, pour into 2-liter jug.\n\n* 1-liter jug: 1 liter\n* 2-liter jug: 3 liters\n\nAnd you have your 3 liters in the 2-liter jug!",

This method allows you to measure out 3 liters without any complex steps or transfers.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Step 1**: Fill the 1-liter jug (1 liter).\n- **Step 2**: Fill the 2-liter jug (2 liters).\n- **Total**: \\( 1 \\, \\text{liter} + 2 \\, \\text{liters} = 3 \\, \\text{liters} \\).\n\nYou have now successfully measured exactly 3 liters using your 1-liter and 2-liter jugs.",

        "## Step 1: Fill the 2-liter jug completely\nFill the 2-liter jug completely with water, so it contains 2 liters.\n\n## Step 2: Pour from the 2-liter jug into the 1-liter jug\nPour water from the 2-liter jug into the 1-liter jug until the 1-liter jug is full, leaving 1 liter remaining in the 2-liter jug.\n\n## Step 3: Empty the 1-liter jug\nEmpty the 1-liter jug completely.\n\n## Step 4: Pour the remaining 1 liter from the 2-liter jug into the 1-liter jug\nPour the remaining 1 liter from the 2-liter jug into the 1-liter jug, so the 1-liter jug now contains 1 liter, and the 2-liter jug is empty.\n\n## Step 5: Fill the 2-liter jug again\nFill the 2-liter jug completely with water again, so it contains 2 liters.\n\n## Step 6: Pour from the 2-liter jug into the 1-liter jug until it's full\nPour water from the 2-liter jug into the 1-liter jug until the 1-liter jug is full, which will only take 0 liters since the 1-liter jug already has 1 liter in it. This means 2 liters remain in the 2-liter jug.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total amount of water measured\nHowever, looking back at the steps, after Step 4, we have 1 liter in the 1-liter jug and then fill the 2-liter jug. To get exactly 3 liters, we need to realize that the process was overcomplicated in the explanation. The correct approach is simpler: Fill the 2-liter jug, pour into the 1-liter jug to fill it, leaving 1 liter in the 2-liter jug. Then, empty the 1-liter jug and fill it with the remaining 1 liter from the 2-liter jug. Finally, fill the 2-liter jug again and pour into the 1-liter jug just enough to fill it, but this description strayed from the most straightforward path to demonstrate the solution directly.\n\n## Step 8: Correct and Simplify the Process\nCorrectly, after filling the 2-liter jug and pouring 1 liter into the 1-liter jug, you have 1 liter left in the 2-liter jug. Then, you fill the 2-liter jug again and use it to fill the 1-liter jug which is empty at that point. This was inaccurately described in the overcomplicated steps above. The right way to measure exactly 3 liters involves correctly utilizing the jugs' capacities to add up to 3 liters without unnecessary pouring back and forth.\n\n## Step 9: Finalize the Correct Method\nFill the 2-liter jug, pour 1 liter into the 1-liter jug. Empty the 1-liter jug, and then fill the 2-liter jug again. Pour from the newly filled 2-liter jug into the 1-liter jug to fill it. This leaves 1 liter in the 2-liter jug and 1 liter in the 1-liter jug from the first fill, achieving a total of 3 liters when combining both jugs' current and previous contents indirectly.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

Transfer the remaining 2 liters from the 2-liter jug into some other container (since the problem states you want to \"measure exactly 3 liters,\" it implies the availability of a container capable of holding the final volume, even if not directly stated).\n9. Refill the 2-liter jug and pour 1 liter into the 1-liter jug. You then have 1 liter remaining in the 2-liter jug.\n10.
